Trained engineers, the Stenberg brothers (1899-1982 / 1900-33) were central to the Russian Constructivist movement. Their achievements included designing theatre sets, women's shoes, posters for the films of Sergei Eisenstein and, in 1947, Vladimir designed the May Day decorations for Red Square. This display presents a 1973 reconstruction of the lost 1919 sculptural prototype for a building, known as 'KPS6', or 'Construction for a Spatial Structure VI'. Related archival material shows the brothers' important role in the Moscow avant-garde on the 1920s, tracing this sculpture's continued influence since its original showing at Moscow's Poet's Cafe in January 1922.]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[388]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[The Henry Moore Institute]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[2657]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[Henry Moore Institute]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[22 Jan 2014 - 20 Apr 2014]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/9090.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/9090.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[10198]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[PAN Berlin Record Label]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[Leeds College of Art welcomes an exhibition from PAN, a critically acclaimed platform for experimental sound and art, based between Berlin and New York. This exhibition showcases a range of artwork produced by the label for PAN artists' records.  
 
Founded in 2008 by artist Bill Kouligas, PAN represents a community of artists united by their singular contributions to the electronic vanguard. PAN has released records by some of the world's most acclaimed electronic and experimental artists over its four year lifespan. The beautiful artwork is a critical part of its success, and, for Bill and label partner Kathryn Politis, a crucial part of the business, conceived as a visual project as much as a musical one.
 
The PAN label boss Bill Kouligas says, "The design of the label has a cohesive aesthetic that the musicians/artists we work with are aware of. There is no fixed process in regards to working with them on the artwork, PAN strive to make something within the concept of their album as far as possible, and we both approve the final artwork. Some artists are more involved than others; some may suggest images they want to use, or drawings of theirs they would like translated into the PVC design. With others we discuss influences that they would like to see incorporated into the design on a more abstract level. In any case, with each release, comes an exchange of ideas. The label was conceived initially as a platform for our artwork and interests. We are trying to not limit ourselves to being a record label in the traditional sense; there have been numerous shows, events, showcases and festivals etc. to date as part of the label, and there are some non-music related projects in the works."

This exhibition is free and open to all members of the public. ]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[5496]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[Leeds College of Art, Blenheim Walk Building]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[10124]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[Leeds College of Art]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[14 Feb 2014 - 16 May 2014]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10198_1.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10198_1.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[8484]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Shoots And Leaves]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[Print exhibition.

The display was brought to Leeds Industrial Museum as part of a continued commitment to draw visitors' attention to industries that remain active in Yorkshire today. The show portrays the mental, social and physical impact mining has on the lives of modern miners and has previously been on display at the National Coal Mining Museum back in 2011. 

Taking nearly twenty years to complete, this multi-layered body of work explores the harshness and dangers of coal mining in one of the last working pits in England. The physicality of the work, the relationship between the underground and the surface, the claustrophobia and darkness of the pit are explored in this collaboration between the photographer Ian Beesley, the poet Ian McMillan and the miners of Hayroyd's colliery.

To celebrate the work of this great Leeds company Armley Mills is exhibiting the Potts family's private collection of clocks for the public for the very first time. Come down and see what really makes them tick.

William Potts began making clocks in Pudsey in 1833 before moving to central Leeds in 1862. With a growing fame for the quality and reliability of their clocks the company received a Royal Warrant from Queen Victoria in 1897. Over five generations the Potts family produced some 1,600 public clocks for towns all over Britain and across the world. 

This exhibition brings together examples spanning the history of the company and features a varied collection of turret clocks, wall clocks, drum clocks and unusual clock-based items. There are prominent royal clocks and an example of the company's famous railway clock from Argentina. There will also be never-before-seen archive documents from the earliest days of the Potts company. Uniquely, all of the clocks on display will be wound daily and will run for the duration of the exhibition. If you've ever wondered what the workings of a cathedral clock look like, or questioned where the tick-tock sound comes from then the Potts of Leeds - Clocks of Character exhibition is the place to get all the answers.

There is no additional charge for visiting this exhibition.

Significantly McLean is a sculptor who has been professor of painting at The Slade for over 25 years and now, recently retired, has been prolific in producing work that continues to enliven and interrogate the very nature of sculpture.

The exhibition draws upon work made by Bruce McLean over 50 years but through the prism of new and recent work. Introducing his work to audiences not familiar with his distinctive, irreverent voice and providing new perspectives by creating surprising junctures between earlier and new work, it shows McLean to be an artist who, frequently joining forces with others, consistently breaks rules, and permits audiences to experience work that disrupts disciplines and breaches borders.

Paintings present sculpture and are sculptural, photography is performance, live works and ceramics act as sculptures. This exhibition aims to get to the heart of this mischievous sense of play and iconoclasm.

The exhibition is a partnership with Firstsite, Colchester.

It is scarcely more than a century since this connection was decisively broken, since we turned our back on the sky and our faces towards the brilliantly lit interiors..' James Attlee: 'Nocturne' 2011

We have traditionally feared the night and wanted to lighten the darkness, but for artists it has also been a zone of uncertainty to capture in painted form.  This display sets Leeds artist Atkinson Grimshaw's much loved 19th century 'moonlights' alongside Turner-prize nominee George Shaw's atmospheric paintings of the housing estate where he grew up (from the Arts Council Collection). 

Also included are paintings by Jack Yeats, George Sauter and Walter Greaves.

This display celebrates the continuing partnership between Leeds Museums & Galleries and the Arts Council Collection, supported by Christies.

Opening Night - Wednesday 26th March 7pm, All Welcome

Situated in Leeds' busy financial district, OVERTIME brings together a diverse group of both emerging and more established practitioners from across the country to explore the differences between the office and the artist's studio.

Often seen as a bureaucratic environment, offices are associated with systemized tasks, the management of data and pro rata salaries, but rarely unregulated creative play. This exhibition seeks to use the unexpected friction generated by placing the work of art in the office to interrogate fixed attitudes towards working practices more generally.

Participating artists & collectives are: 
Lily Ackroyd-Willoughby 
Mike Ainsworth 
Anachron-Gen 
Alice Bradshaw 
Lydia Catterall 
Spike Dennis 
Natalie Drenth 
Emma Hardaker 
Phill Hopkins

Helen's exhibition 'Sodium Laureth Sulphate' consists of mixed media paintings and a digital projection.

Her process is spontaneous and instinctive, using media such as acrylics on canvas, boards and cardboard; watercolours, felt tip pens, ribbons and gems. Using imagery from her subconscious, intuitive mark making, and reacting to found pictures and music, Helen creates an uncertain world, sometimes confusing, wondering, atmospheric and difficult to identify.

Fred's exhibition 'The Gallery Is Now Closed' features a display of his ongoing movie monster monoprint series, accompanied by a loop of the video-collage Wastin' Arrers and the sound piece Mr. Leech's Institution by Lynden St. John for Octopus Collective, for which the artist provided voice performance.

Fred Pepper works in an illustrative style and within a narrative tradition. His practice centres on drawing and printmaking, but he also makes forays into the territories of performance, sculpture, digital media and painting.
He was born a Sagittarius on a Woden's Day in a Year of the Wood Rabbit.]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[10534]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[The Crooked House]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[27 Mar 2014 - 2 Apr 2014]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10535.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10535.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[10116]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Yesterday]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[Alongside In Pursuit of the Exquisite, a complimentary contemporary exhibition in the Terrace Gallery, Yesterday, will feature the work of artists Dan Scott and Michelle Taylor.

A collaboration between photographer Casey Orr, writer/musician Boff Whalley and curator Jenny Harris, Bicyclism includes a series of new portraits of (extra) ordinary Leeds cyclists, from stunt bikers in skate parks to local men and women who pedal daily well into old age, alongside crowd-sourced and archive images of Leeds people on their bikes.

The exhibition will unearth stories and histories of the area's cycling past, from the socialist Clarion Clubs to the role played by bicycles in the suffrage movement, from cycling cafe culture to the role of the many cycling clubs (and the cyclists) in Leeds' social history, geography and landscape.

A new soundtrack composed using bicycles will accompany the exhibition. Watch the live at the Museum on Thursday 26th June. 

Be Part Of It: If you have a photo in your album of you or a family member on their bike that you would like to submit for inclusion in the exhibition visit www.bicyclism.co.uk for more information.]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[385]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[Leeds City Museum]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[7293]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[Leeds Museums & Galleries]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[24 Jun 2014 - 7 Jul 2014]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10115.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10115.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[9531]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Bloom: Print Exhibition]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[Ruth Green and Sue Vanderplank explore the wonderful world of flowers with their unique screen prints.
