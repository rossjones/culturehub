Its about a 15-20 minute cycle ride, but traffic free almost all the way - so its a great way to get to know the way to Skelton Grange.]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[5420]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[Skelton Grange Environment Centre]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[5423]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[Skelton Grange]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[21 Feb 2014 - 28 Mar 2014]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/9057_0.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/9057_0.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[9510]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[St Patrick's Day Parade]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[The Leeds St Patrick's Day Parade is in its fifthteenth year and is a celebration of all things Irish.

We shall also visit several of the houses where he lived, contextualising his Leeds period and exploring aspects of his mythology, which was already well developed at this time.

This walk is 4.5 miles and finishes at the West Park Cafe; for
optional refreshments.

LitFest Literary Scarecrow Festival.

Enter the festival. Follow the trail. Go to the scarecrow meet.

All scarecrows must have some sort of literary connection,
however loose - e.g. a character (human, animal or scarecrow) in a book, poem or play. 

There will be an end-of-trail 'scarecrow meet' at the community orchard near St Chad's church on Sunday 6 April from 2pm onwards. 

Or for only &pound;1 you can just follow the scarecrow trail from 29 to 30 March, see how many scarecrows you can find and help to judge the winning entries. Buy your scarecrow trail map from HEART, Headingley library or local shops or check
the FHVS website for other sources.

The Committee have chosen this years theme to reflect the ongoing push for change and equality and recognise the legalisation to allow same sex marriage in the United Kingdom. Love&Marriage will feature strongly in our campaign and shows as we celebrate this important milestone in LGB&T rights.

Its time to buy a hat!

This year, we are pleased to introduce Gay Leeds Legends Kira & Degsie as your Parade Stage hosts as well as inviting back the one and only Miss Orry on Main Stage - flying back from Gran Canaria to join her is Chelsea from Ricky's Cabaret Bar.

Starting in Millennium Square at midday, the parade stage officially kicks off Leeds Pride with speakers and a selection of performances. Then join the parade through Leeds as it winds its way down to Briggate or "Gay Leeds" where the party continues.

The main stage in the heart of the LGBT community will showcase even more local stars as well as popular LGBT scene performers, camp cabaret, a headliner and our ever popular dance session. 

We are the UK's fastest growing LGB&T pride and the biggest
annual street event in the City of Leeds. With your support we hope to continue delivering a top class pride for Leeds. Here is just a taster of what's to come...

Stooshe
