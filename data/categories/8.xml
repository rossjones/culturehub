PAGES is pleased to announce its new partnership with The Tetley. With the past use and present structure of the building in mind, a series of exhibitions and installations are also in development alongside the fair, on the themes of archive and office, stationary and document, marginalia and cataloguing, and accumulations and inventories. The event will also incorporate a comprehensive series of discussions, lectures and forums during the Saturday and Sunday, and related exhibitions across the city. 

Highlights will include Image>Archive<Memory, an exhibition by British-Armenian artist Karen Babayan, with performances by London-based dancer Shakeh Major Tchilingirian, and a talk by Research Professor in Curation and Art History, Lynda Morris, at the Artists' Book Fair Dinner. See 'Events' pages for booking details.

Three monthly sessions. The series offers a compact survey of Jacob Ross' immensely popular and highly regarded technical creative approach to crafting fiction. His very successful course has been running for more than fifteen years. Many beginning writers developed and fine-tuned their writing skills in his course, to the point where their work has been shortlisted in major competitions, or won prizes.

Narrative Drive is for writers who want to maximise the quality and impact of their work. At the end of the series you will have a better awareness of your own strengths and weakness as a writer and the steps you need to take to address them. We will examine the building blocks of stories and how they work together to produce strong memorable narratives.

The series will expose you to the very best examples of modern fiction from which you can learn and refine your skills. Your knowledge of contemporary themes and styles will be enhanced. This course is for advanced writers already working on their novel-in-progress or their collection of short stories. You will be required to submit work in advance of the course.]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[8638]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[TBC]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[1638]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[INSCRIBE & Peepal Tree Press]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[18 Jan 2014 - 15 Mar 2014]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/8639.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/8639.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[10129]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Words On Tap Survival Kit]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[Presented by Headingley Litfest. 

Local poet and Words on Tap host Matthew Hedley Stoppard will lead a workshop focusing on some essentials to perpetuate your poetry. The afternoon will incorporate the importance of 'voice' using vinyl recordings of poets, technique and figures of speech, with close attention to zeugma, and poetry games. Any profits from this event will be donated to Help for Heroes. Contact: wordsontap@email.com

Following on from the Words on Tap workshops held at All Hallows Church in Hyde Park in spring last year, this session will encourage the beginnings of poems rather than force finished articles by the end of the three hours. The workshop leader also aims to prompt discussion amongst attendees and examine the reader's perceptions of poetry.

Matthew Hedley Stoppard was born in Derbyshire and lives in East Leeds with his wife and children. His debut collection A Family Behind Glass was included in The Guardian's Readers' Books of the Year 2013 and his poems and stories appear in various magazines and anthologies, both in print and online, and green vinyl disc. He is also a competition winner and founder/organiser/host of monthly not-for-profit literary event Words on Tap.]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[956]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[Headingley Enterprise and Arts Centre (HEART)   ]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[15 Mar 2014 2:00pm - 5:00pm]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10129.JPG]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10129.JPG]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[10588]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Writing For Surviving]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[The Workers' Educational Association presents a collection of poetry, short stories and plays based around the LitFest theme of surviving.

We are hosting a rehearsed reading of the script, written by Yorkshire based poet Ian McMillan. There is an original score performed live with singing.

"On the blood dark sea the ship is barely moving 
There's a sail as torn as a shattered shirt 
Something is aboard the ship..."

Nosferatu tells the dark and mysterious tale of the sailors in Bram Stokers novel Dracula, as they journey from Varna to Whitby with an unknown cargo.

This is a fantastic chance to be one of the first to see a new groundbreaking piece of theatre, feeding into the shaping and impression of the play, which will embark on a national tour in 2015. We need your feedback so please join us for an evening of blood, danger and art! 

Proper Job Theatre Company is based in the North of England creating and touring new work as well as large-scale theatre events. Proper Job are passionate about continuously developing projects that excite us, fire our curiosity and expand our imagination. ]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[304]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[Carriageworks Theatre]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[20 Mar 2014 7:30pm]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/9905.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/9905.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[10592]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Gillian Clarke ]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[With John Wedgewood Clarke.

We are very pleased to welcome Gillian Clarke, the National Poet of Wales, to Headingley LitFest. Gillian, to our great delight, has agreed to headline our poetry event on 20 March in the place of Jo Shapcott who is now unable to take part this year.

Gillian is a central figure in contemporary Welsh poetry and her poems have achieved widespread critical and popular acclaim. The Poetry Archive celebrates her achievements noting that: Listening to a Gillian Clarke poem is an intensely sensual experience; her use of language "concrete as it is
musical" (Times Literary Supplement) and the patterning of rhyme and alliteration combine to give the impression of a poem as an almost physical object...

Gillian Clarke was born in Cardiff and lives in Ceredigion. National Poet for Wales since 2008, she is President of TÃÂÃÂ· Newydd, the Welsh Writers Centre which she co-founded in 1990. Her work is widely studied for GCSE and A Level. She has published thirteen books for adults, and several for children as writer, translator or editor. Her first prose collection, At the Source, ap-peared in 2008. Her recent collection of poems, Ice, was short-listed for the TS Eliot Award 2012. In December 2010 she was awarded the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry, and in 2012 the Wilfred Owen Award.

John Wedgwood Clarke was born in St.Ives, Cornwall and now lives in Scarborough. He founded and ran the Beverley Literature Festival and Bridlington Poetry Festival until 2012.]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[956]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[Headingley Enterprise and Arts Centre (HEART)   ]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[6703]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[Headingley LitFest]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[20 Mar 2014 7:30pm]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10592.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10592.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[9397]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[A Day of Pleasure ]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[Stories of a boy growing up in Warsaw. New York, 1978. 

The cab driver is waiting to take him to the airport. The evening before he travels to Stockholm to collect the Nobel Prize for Literature, Isaac Bashevis Singer - a passionate, brilliant storyteller - recalls a fascinating childhood full of mystery, torment and adventure.

A Day of Pleasure is about more than a young boy growing up in a strange and exotic world; it is about growing up itself. Singer brings to life the vivid characters of pre-war Warsaw, his own character and the human conditions that affect us all.

Yet the poetic output of British, Dominion and American troops was far more extensive than the well known works of the best known poets.

This event will explore some of the lesserknown poems and poetry, including works by A.E. Mackintosh and Alan Seegar, as well as poetry published in hospital fundraising magazines such as The Gazette of the Third London General Hospital.

Dr Jessica Meyer will discuss how such poetry has informed her own work as a historian of the First World War and the continuing cultural impact of war poetry on British understandings of the war and its centenary commemoration.

Whether 'home' means a back-to-back terraced house, a tent pitched in a bit of wasteland, or an abandoned rocket on the surface of the moon, Fictions invites you to riff off real or imaginary dwellings past or present. 

Our invited speakers at this event are: 

ZODWA NYONI Zimbabwean-born poet and playwright, who has held residencies at BBC Radio Leeds and at the Ilkley Literature Festival, Zodwa was recently named one of Leeds' 20 best writers under 40, and is certainly one of Fictions' favourite poets. Don't miss this opportunity to see her in action!

NASSER HUSSAIN Nasser is looking forward to the forthcoming publication of his first collection of spoken word poems, entitled 'boldface' - available this summer from Burning Eye Press. In the meantime he teaches literature and creative writing at Leeds Metropolitan University, and is currently at work on something completely different. 

Music at this event will come from DAVID BROAD.

OPEN MIC. There will be a writers' open mic, at which contributions of flash fiction, short fiction, true stories, and excerpts of larger work will all be welcome. You MUST keep your contributions under 6 minutes because if you go over, YOU WILL BE STOPPED. Even in the middle of a sentence if it comes to it. Please practise reading your work out to check that it comes in under 6 minutes - we're taking the very un-Fictions-like step of being firm about this.

A man who often says things he shouldn't. He once made a wise crack to a lady in passing and now, 35 years later and racked with guilt, he has tracked her down to your neighbourhood to apologise.

But saying sorry isn't always that simple... Witness the most elaborate apology in history as Harry introduces us to the family, friends, enemies, mystics and con men that make up his uniquely funny and moving life story. Prepare for a host of throw away lines and dry humour as Harry prepares to make amends.

This heart-warming new production marks the first ever UK stage adaptation of a work by the great American writer Saul Bellow, three times winner of the National Book Award and winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature.

From rumours that Anne Boleyn sold her soul for her crown to the Faustian pacts of the technology age, Hilary Mantel investigates the history of the human relationship with the devil.

The double Man Booker Prize-winning author (Wolf Hall, Bring up the Bodies) says that whilst growing up, the devil was a vital presence in her own life and so it was only natural that he should feature in her novels. In this specially commissioned talk, she traces the footsteps of the devil in her life, her fiction and in today's world.

This talk has been rescheduled from Autumn 2012 and includes live music from violinist David le Page.
