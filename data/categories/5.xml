This exhibition showcases a range of artwork produced by the label for PAN artists' records.  
 
Founded in 2008 by artist Bill Kouligas, PAN represents a community of artists united by their singular contributions to the electronic vanguard. PAN has released records by some of the world's most acclaimed electronic and experimental artists over its four year lifespan. The beautiful artwork is a critical part of its success, and, for Bill and label partner Kathryn Politis, a crucial part of the business, conceived as a visual project as much as a musical one.
 
The PAN label boss Bill Kouligas says, "The design of the label has a cohesive aesthetic that the musicians/artists we work with are aware of. There is no fixed process in regards to working with them on the artwork, PAN strive to make something within the concept of their album as far as possible, and we both approve the final artwork. Some artists are more involved than others; some may suggest images they want to use, or drawings of theirs they would like translated into the PVC design. With others we discuss influences that they would like to see incorporated into the design on a more abstract level. In any case, with each release, comes an exchange of ideas. The label was conceived initially as a platform for our artwork and interests. We are trying to not limit ourselves to being a record label in the traditional sense; there have been numerous shows, events, showcases and festivals etc. to date as part of the label, and there are some non-music related projects in the works."

This exhibition is free and open to all members of the public. ]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[5496]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[Leeds College of Art, Blenheim Walk Building]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[10124]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[Leeds College of Art]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[14 Feb 2014 - 16 May 2014]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10198_1.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10198_1.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[9484]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Toby Greenwood's "We Free Kings"]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[feat Toby Greenwood sax and leader, Kevin Holbrough trombone, Jim Corry  baritone sax, Jamil Sheriff on piano, Garry Jackson string bass and Chris Sykes drums

We are looking for people who enjoy singing to take part in a 10 week choir project. No experience is necessary but enthusiasm is essential!

There are many things we take for granted about the place we live in - and what is familiar to one person may be surprising to someone else. 365 Leeds Stories is a way of sharing our experience of the city in a creative and informal way.

Since September 2013, Leeds-based artists Matthew Bellwood and Alison Andrews have been working together with a range of people who live, work or seek residence in Leeds on the creation of series of maps of the city; maps that tell stories and make connections between the people who live there. They have been rendered in different forms - expressed in textiles, written in stories, floated down the river or rendered as conventional cartographic representations, albeit with a twist.

In November and December, we ran two day-long workshops with composer James Redwood. These were open to anyone in the city who wanted to come along and join in. We spent the first day getting to know each other and sharing ideas, thoughts, feelings and impressions of the city, before settling down to write some lyrics that we felt summed up our experiences of living in Leeds. The material we created was quite diverse - quirky, poetic and sometimes slightly sinister. By the end of the first day, we felt we had the basis for three different songs.

The following week, we worked with James to set the songs to music. James led us in a series of warm-ups, which got us on our feet and singing together and then helped us to find our way into the songs, deciding on a tone and mood for each one, pulling out melodies and rhythms from the group and shaping the resultant material. He then took the pieces away with him to polish up and score.

From 24th February onwards, we'll be working with vocal animateur Caroline Challis to bring these songs to life, with a view to singing them at the opening of the project exhibition in Leeds Central Library on 3rd May.

Rehearsals will be at the Central Library on Monday evenings (6.15pm - 7.45pm) from 24th February.]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[476]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[Leeds Central Library]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[10019]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[365 Leeds Stories]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[24 Feb 2014 - 28 Apr 2014]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10020.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10020.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[9287]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Hy Brasil]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[The isle is full of noises

'In the world of wildlife sound recording, Chris Watson is the daddy' The Guardian


Hy Brasil is a mysterious, enchanted island, hidden in fog somewhere off the coast of Ireland. It reveals itself to human eye and ear just one day every seven years. This specially commissioned work by sound artist Chris Watson (BBC TV's award-winning Frozen Planet), brings that day on Hy Brasil to life in an immersive sound installation.

Hy Brasil is composed of compelling wildlife sounds from around the world, drawing visitors deep into the haunting song of seals and the awe-inspiring shrieks of thousands of Manx shearwaters. With glorious ambi-sonic sound and beautiful lighting, lose yourself in the strange and magical world of Hy Brasil.

Martin's latest album MOJO FIX which was recorded in Texas, comes on the heels of four critically celebrated albums, years of touring and countless festivals that have built Martin a strong and solid fan-base spanning the globe.

Martin is a deeply important and respected voice in the evolution of popular blues and folk oriented guitar and vocals. He is now expanding on his international success with recent time spent in the US recording and touring.

A life long devotee of acoustic guitar music, especially the ageless blues/roots sounds, Martin has travelled the globe absorbing a plethora of diverse influences and honing his craft into the classic song-writing style he possesses today.

Renowned for his prowess as a slide guitarist, he is almost unique in the UK in his playing lap slide. In other areas and styles, however, he has proved himself a master guitarist and a consistently astounding songwriter. Look for Martin's videos "Winter Coat", "Love In the Afternoon", and "Mojo Fix" taken from the album of the same name.]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[1529]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[The Brudenell Social Club]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[4204]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[Brudenell Social Club]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[12 Mar 2014 7:30pm]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10174.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10174.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[10175]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Grails]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[With support from Lilacs and Champagne.

Composing music that both embraces and challenges western classical traditions, Gabriel has emerged at the forefront of a new approach to classical music in the UK at the beginning of the 21st century.

His Concerto for Turntables was performed at the BBC Proms in August 2011 to critical acclaim, conducted by Vladimir Jurowski with world champion DJ Switch as soloist, and broadcast on BBC2 television.

Other recent works include a poly-stylistic 'orchestral remix' of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony commissioned by John Axelrod and the Orchestre National des Pays de la Loire, France, performed sold-out concert halls in Angers and Nantes in June 2011; a 3rd String Quartet premiered by the Ruysdael Kwartet at the Wigmore Hall in 2010; 'import/export/ a percussion suite for Global Junk, toured in UK & USA by Joby Burgess's Powerplant; and a book for Solo Piano recorded by Russian virtuoso GeNIA.

Prokofiev's own distinctive sound is informed by his background as a producer of hip-hop, grime, and electro records, as well as his earlier involvement in electroacoustic music at York and Birmingham universities, which saw him win a Residency prize at the prestigious Bourges International Electroacoustic Music Competition in 1998.]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[1364]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[The Cockpit]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[8992]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[Leeds College of Music]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[13 Mar 2014 7:30pm]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10276.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10276.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[10527]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[The Republic Of Fentonia]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[The Republic of Fentonia presents:

Their punk roots are obvious, but they've evolved into something a little different.

RADIO PARTIZAN (old-skool punk/folk)

Stalwarts of the Leeds punk/post-punk scene, a three piece into sharp songs, great guitar riffs and radical politics, including members of The Monkeywrenchers, so its should be no surprise that a bit of folk-punk creeps into their old-skool punk sets. Great tunes, great performers, lovely people!

DEAD SEA STRATEGY (hardcore folk-punk)

"We formed mid 2013, rising from the ashes of previous line ups and are now ready to take over the world. We'll never be folk to the folkies and we'll never be punk to the punks and we really couldn't care less, we play what we think sounds good and make friends along the way."

Sounds punk to me!

Verdi Nabucco: Overture
Puccini Manon Lescaut: Intermezzo
Tchaikovsky Francesca da Rimini
Elgar Enigma Variations

The City of Leeds Youth Orchestra's performances in recent years are one of the great success stories of music making in the region. The orchestra now numbers nearly 100 young musicians and this programme is perfect to show off these wonderful young talents.

The orchestra will be touring to Perugia in July 2014 and the concert's first half is full of Italian inspiration - Verdi's dramatic overture to Nabucco followed by the most beautiful orchestral intermezzo in all Puccini operas and Tchaikovsky's finest tone poem, which was inspired by the tragic tale of Francesca in Dante's Divine Comedy.

Join us for the start of a brand new blues experience in Leeds!

The Squeeze is a monthly blues dance event where you can learn authentic blues and blues fusion dance, and move to some of the most sultry and smoking tunes north of Memphis - music from Nina Simone to Nora Jones, Ray Charles to James Blake.

Low lights glisten, shimmering images of projected dancers glide overhead.  The sound of Delta blues, cool jazz and current soul fills the air as pairs of dancers shimmy, shake and slide across the dancefloor with seemingly effortless abandon.  This is the cutting edge of contemporary blues dance, this is The Squeeze.

Beginners Blues Class 8pm - 9pm 
Social Blues Dance 9pm - midnight
No experience necessary or partner required 

Cosy venue, delicious food and drinks!

FAQs

What is Blues Dance? 
Blues dance is a distinctive style of dancing which developed alongside blues music more than 100 years ago and is still developing today, with a huge revival in many cities all over the world. 

I've never danced (anything!) before, can I still join?
Absolutely, the class at 8pm will be aimed at absolute beginners, but there will enough content to satisfy those who have previously danced blues too.

Do I need to buy a ticket?
It's strongly recommended that you buy a ticket beforehand as similar events have sold out, and due to the cosy nature of the venue, once we get to capacity, to ensure our dancers' comfort and safety, we will not be allowing any more participants.  The only way to guarantee your place at the dance is to buy a ticket beforehand.

What do I need to bring?
Just your ticket (otherwise it's &pound;5 on the door, if we still have space).  Wear comfortable clothes and shoes. You're welcome to come along with a partner or group of friends, but many people come on their own, and as long as there's space, we will accommodate you, whatever group size you are.

What kind of music do you play?
We play everything from traditional blues and swing jazz from the 1920s onwards, right up to blues-friendly tunes from the last few years, including a sprinkling of soul, r&b and torch songs.

Why the Squeeze?
Blues dancing is best suited to cosy, informal venues, and as Upstairs at LS6 has a maximum capacity of 60 people, the name just seemed to fit!]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[10497]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[Upstairs at LS6 Cafe]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[10498]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[James F Clark]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[16 Mar 2014 8:00pm - 11:45pm]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10499.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10499.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[10056]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Leeds College Of Music Jazz Ensemble]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[Tim Garland is one of the UKs best travelled jazz soloists, not only having been a regular with Chick Corea for fourteen years, but also creating repertoires for the trios Lighthouse, Acoustic Triangle and Storms/Nocturnes.

"Too Much Pressure" released by this important and influential platinum selling band in Feb 1980 remains a classic touchstone for a generation of Ska lovers and the band are excited to announce they will be playing the album in its entirety plus a selection of other much loved Selecter tracks and some new surprises at concerts throughout 2011.

Mixing punk, ska and reggae, 'Too Much Pressure' successfully reflected the social and political issues of the early Thatcher years in Britain and gave a voice to disaffected youth across the racial divide.

The Selecter fronted by the original singing duo of the female icon of the 2-tone era Pauline Black & Arthur 'Gaps' Hendrickson deliver classic hits like 'Three Minute Hero', 'Missing Words', 'On My Radio', 'James Bond' and of course 'Too Much Pressure'.

2011 saw the return of one of the most vital, visceral and important Ska acts ever. Queen of 2- Tone, Pauline Black featured prominently in BBC4's "Reggae Britannia" series, contributing to a 90 mins documentary and a live concert broadcast from The Barbican in London.

The Selecter's new 10 track album 'Made In Britain', featuring covers of Amy Winehouse's 'Back To Black' & a hugely popular anti-racist ska/reggae re-working of Woody Guthrie's 'All You Fascists Bound To Lose'- re-invented as 'Big In The Body- Small In The Mind', which was released in September 2011.

2012 saw The Selecter embark on a 32 date tour of the UK throughout the year, with many venues selling out in advance. Dec 2012 saw the band do their first ever tour of Australia which was a huge success.

2013 saw the band play another 20 dates in the UK in March and then in April the band went back to the USA for the first time in many years culminating in an appearance at the influential Coachella Festival. The band have plans to go back to the USA two more times in 2013 and plans for the Far East and South America in 2014.

Pauline Black has also written a well-received 2-Tone memoir, 'Black By Design' which has been published by 'Serpent's Tail' and released in July 2011. She made an appearance at the Edinburgh International Book Festival in August 2011. The book is released in the US in June 2012.

"'Multiculturalism rules', The Selecter'sÂ® Pauline Black says pointedly, hours after David Cameron has declared it dead. In a Midlands rude-girl suit of sharp straight lines, she brings 2-Tone's faster, jerky punk beat and the needling New Wave aggro of 'On My Radio', to which a platoon of fans jog along. - Nick Hasted, The Independent

"...a slick, attacking set from Pauline Black" - Robin Denselow, The Guardian]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[1529]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[The Brudenell Social Club]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[4204]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[Brudenell Social Club]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[22 Mar 2014 7:30pm]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10176.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10176.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[10426]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Expansions: Jay Daniel]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[If any of you have heard his mixes or caught him on the Boiler Room, you'll know that Jay throws it down right.

Sessions aim to introduce music, drama and movement at the earliest stages of a child's development to spark a life-long connection with the arts.  They also provide the ideal environment in which adults and infants can bond through creative play.

Twenty years earlier, the head of Decca records, Dick Rowe, had made the biggest A&R gaff in pop history with the legendary clanger "Guitar groups are on their way out, Mr Epstein". But in 1982, Rowe's apocalyptic prophecy suddenly sounded frighteningly real. After the initial roar and storm of punk, British pop music had succumbed to a synthesizer-driven pursuit of new waves and new romanticisms. In an age of Vienna's, Tainted Love's and Too Shy's, the pure sound of six-stringed, melodic pop - be it as amorous as The Beatles, as lascivious as The Stones or as giddy as T.Rex - was fast becoming a lost cause with few willing to fight its corner.

After completing his A level examinations at Fulneck School, Toby was awarded the tenor Choral Scholarship at Gloucester Cathedral, for the academic year 2013/14. In October 2014, Toby took up a tenor choral scholarship in the choir of King's College, Cambridge.

Toby's musical talent was spotted early, at Bramhope Primary School, and he received piano lessons from the late Michael Sykes of Pool-in-Wharfedale. After a short period at Abbey Grange Church of England High School, Toby was awarded a music scholarship to Fulneck School.

Toby, in his first year at King's reading music, is one of fifteen choral scholars who comprise the back row of the famous King's College Choir, formed in 1516. Following a long tradition, the scholars form a touring group now known as The King's Men, performing regularly around Britain, and recently as far afield as North America, Australia and Hong Kong.

Toby said:
It will be a huge pleasure to return to Leeds Minster, the scene of my early musical education. It was a concert by The King's Men at the minster which inspired me to apply to King's in the first place, so I hope we can help inspire the next generation of the Minster's young musicians, while delivering an entertaining program of music from 500 years ago to the present day.

Dr Simon Lindley, Master of the Music at Leeds Minster said:
We have welcomed the King's choral scholars to Leeds on a number of occasions in the recent past and the students have been of great assistance in raising the profile of choral music here at the Minster. It's obviously particularly special having Toby return this year as a current King's alumnus. Minster Parishioners, along with staff, parents and students at Toby's schools have expressed considerable interest in attending, as have members and friends of Minster-based St Peter's Singers in which Toby sang for a number of years as a teenager, graduating eventually to the solo ranks.
The King's Men is the close harmony group formed from the Choral Scholars of the Choir of King's College, Cambridge. As Choral Scholars they follow the daily routine of Chapel services throughout term, as well as undertaking a busy concert and recording schedule in the vacations.

The Choir is, of course, most famous for the broadcast of the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols on radio each Christmas, and its companion programme, Carols from King's, on BBC television.

The King's Men, however, functions separately from the main Choir, and is run entirely by the members of the group itself. It performs regularly around Britain, and has performed as far afield as North America, Australia and Hong Kong.]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[4897]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[Leeds Minster]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[5384]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[Leeds Minster]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[25 Mar 2014 7:30pm - 9:00pm]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/9947.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/9947.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[9680]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Leeds College Of Music New Music Collective]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[The New Music Collective is an amplified cross-over ensemble of mixed instruments, often using electronics within live performance.

The New Babylon score is full of moments in which the music directly, unambiguously accompanies the screen' NY Times
Trauberg and Kozintsev's great masterpiece of Soviet avant-garde cinema is a powerful story of the 1871 Paris commune told through the eyes of a shop-girl working in the New Babylon emporium.

Scored by the then 23 year old Dmitri Shostakovich, the film is accompanied live by the Orchestra of Opera North. Bursting with jazz and cabaret inspired music, this is Shostakovich at his most satirical. Together, the film and music reflect both on revolutionary Russia and the enduring Russian fascination with Paris.

Lose yourself in the thrilling world of spectacle and the macabre and wake up with fresh eyes.

Ever dreamt of running away with the circus?

With moments of high pathos, circus spectacle and powerful narrative Rogue Theatre tells the stories of three lost souls who sign up to run away with Madame Lucinda, mother, father, devil, angel, alter ego and ring master.

The show mixes the bright lights of the circus with moments of intimacy, to tell the stories of each of the characters and how they ended up at their crossroads where Madame Lucinda found them. As the play unfolds, the audience shares the secret moments between characters backstage, alone in the dressing rooms, gaining insight into their dreams, fears and heartache: 

Sirus, formerly Mr Johnson, the frustrated office clerk who lived in his imagination but failed to see the subtle beauty of the world around him

LoLo, circus orphan, whose father was killed in a tragically comic circus accident involving a flying pig

Svetlana, the dancing doll, destined to live a half-life with a broken heart trapped inside her wooden exterior.

With live music by the original musical director Ben Sutcliffe, mesmerising vocals, poetry and text by Annamaria Murphy (Kneehigh Theatre (Trystan and Yseult and Red Shoes), Radio 4, National Theatre), illusion, magic, side splitting comedy, ballet, whip cracking, explosive physical performance and powerful narrative.

Journey through the doors of the imagination into a world of mystery, spectacle and horror!

Marvel at the exquisite heartache, the torturous hilarity and breathtaking magic.

Antlered Man and The Witch Hunt.

Black Moth are Harriet Bevan - vocals, Jim Swainston - guitar, Nico Carew - guitar, Dave Vachon - bass, and Dom McCready plays drums.

Formed in 2010 out of the ashes of a Leeds-based garage rock band, the band were seduced by the brutal and hypnotic lure of the riff, to emerge translucent skinned and bleary eyed from their cocoon as the ferocious kick-ass heavy rock outfit that is Black Moth.

Taking a powerful chunk of influence from proto-punk acts such as Iggy and the Stooges, Motorhead and early Alice Cooper as well as a sliver of 90s grunge and stoner rock, Black Moth draw out the darker elements and combine them with the heaving riffs of heavy metal giants, Pentagram and Black Sabbath, with hooks so sharp you could hang a corpse on them. They also look to more current acts such as the Melvins, Sleep and Electric Wizard for inspiration, though singer, Harriet Bevan, still maintains a vocal style that evokes the haunting psychedelia of Grace Slick and psych-Satanist, Jinx Dawson from Coven: the woman responsible for the "sign of the horns" in rock'n'roll.

Songs that the band have honed and crafted in the mighty maelstrom that is the Leeds heavy rock scene, have been rippin' 'em up live not only in Yorkshire but everywhere they've played. Now all they needed was to be brought to vivid screaming life on record.

Enter Mr Jim Sclavunos, the multi talented Grinderman and Bad Seed, not to mention the superbaaad connoisseur of the mixing console, fresh from producing the storming second Jim Jones Revue album.

One of their shows was all it took. "Black Moth reminds me of my misspent youth" he said.]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[1529]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[The Brudenell Social Club]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[4204]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[Brudenell Social Club]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[29 Mar 2014 7:30pm]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10177.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10177.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[10396]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Salsa Celtica]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[PLUS UK'S PREMIER SALSA DJS AND CALLE OCHO RESIDENTS LUBI, FABIO BAHIA AND DR SALSA

The Passion follows very much in the traditions of Stainer [The Crucifixion of 1887] and Maunder [Olivet to Calvary of 1904]. 

The passion narrative unfolds mainly in recitative drawn from Gospel texts, while solo arias and "choral meditations", with words probably by Somervell himself, reflect on the action. As in the Stainer and Maunder pieces, there are hymns for all to sing. Somervell's music is throughout reflective and beautiful and at times exquisite.

"It is, truly, a forgotten masterpiece," said conductor Dr Simon Lindley, "I remember obtaining a copy some years ago from a colleague who was organist of Holy Trinity Church in Boar Lane, and have been wanting for decades to give the piece an airing. The centenary year of its first performance provides us with an excellent opportunity!"]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[4897]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[Leeds Minster]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[6327]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[St Peter's Singers]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[30 Mar 2014 6:30pm - 8:00pm]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/9728.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/9728.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[9250]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Jack Bruce & His Big Brass Band]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[Composer, singer and multi-instrumentalist Jack Bruce is best known as a member of Cream.

They decided to take the winter of 2012 off to work on new material in Brooklyn. The converted founding member Mark Perro's bedroom in Bushwick into a practice space and rehearsed there nearly every day for three months, cutting more than 40 demos. By the end of that winter, the Men had pared that crop of songs down to 13. With their plans to take a break foiled by their own work ethic, they decided to record those songs before New Moon came out. They booked two days at Brooklyn's Strange Weather studios, clocked in, and tracked all 13 songs entirely live, even including a horn section.

Eight songs from those sessions made the final cut for The Men's new LP, Tomorrow's Hits. This is their first album recorded in a high-end studio and, appropriately, the result is their most high fidelity album to date. That being said, it is still an incredibly straightforward record. Tomorrow's Hits is a concise collection of songs that nonetheless expands the band's ever-evolving musical palette. It's full of genre-bending risks, but it reinforces the overarching theme that has come to define its makers: The Men are a great rock band.]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[1529]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[The Brudenell Social Club]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[4204]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[Brudenell Social Club]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[30 Mar 2014 7:30pm]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10372.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10372.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[10178]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[La Luz]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[Seattle's La Luz recorded their debut EP, Damp Face, in a small trailer on a hot August day.

Brandon's 2012 gig at Seven Arts was a tenor/trumpet/organ/drums affair. This time he returns with a new line up showcasing his exciting unashamedly emotional soaked- in- the-blues-tradition tenor style. Australian- born, London-resident, Brandon's playing is firmly in the hard bop tradition of Art Blakey and Horace Silver but he's no mere copyist.- Jack Massaryk in the Evening Standard praised his 'world-class performance, swing, invention and stunning instrumental technique.' He has a rich, powerful sound enabling him to steam through up-tempo numbers and channel tenderness through quieter ones. His new quartet features Ross Stanley on piano, the great Mick Hutton on bass and Chris Higginbottom on drums, a regular in the Ronnie Scott's All-Stars.

Having already performed and paid tribute to Black at the Royal Festival Hall premiere of A Life In Song - Lyrics By Don Black - Wilmot will bring his unique interpretation to some of Black's most famous and iconic songs, marking his 50th anniversary in the business to the backdrop of an orchestra, whilst also taking a narrative role telling the story of one of our greatest ever lyricists.

"The New Mastersounds, from the Yorkshire city of Leeds, are part of a vast British network tied together through their love of classic American R&B, funk and souljazz. What sets The New Mastersounds apart is their expertise: the keyboard-driven collective comes on like a juiced-up, highly kinetic New Orleans version of Booker T & the MGs and their jazzy style has earned them praise from their idols - Maceo Parker, The Neville Brothers, the JBs and The Meters among others."

Performing both self-penned and traditional material, she won the Horizon Award at the 2012 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. Lucy's sophomore album "Single Flame" is LAAH founder Steve Thackray's album of 2013, and has garnered rave reviews, but it's her live performances that have made her one of the hottest acts in Britfolk, and why we're very excited to have her playing for us once more.

http://www.lucywardsings.com/

For her April 14 tour she has recruited a stellar collection of musicians for her band: O'Hooley and Tidow, Joy Gravestock (Orchestral fiddler), Sam Pegg (bassist) & Steve Maclachlan from The Willows on percussion.

Support comes from Atlum Schema: aka Andy Mort. Described as "electro-political folk" by the Guardian, Andy's another Live At All Hallows team favourite. His new album Year 0 is out in March 14, about which he says "Year 0 came together over just two weeks in the summer of 2013. It confronts themes of loss, the frailty of the human body, the potential strength of human spirit and the absurd attention and importance we collectively give to futile things. Initially intended as a stripped back, acoustic record, it grew through the recording process into an ambient spirited, reflective, electronic exploration of the human condition. It is about discovering in the past the inescapable clues to the mysteries of the future, and the idea that every moment that passes by is another opportunity to weave something new."

'Mantel... instinctively grabs for the reachably real' The New Yorker

From rumours that Anne Boleyn sold her soul for her crown to the Faustian pacts of the technology age, Hilary Mantel investigates the history of the human relationship with the devil.

The double Man Booker Prize-winning author (Wolf Hall, Bring up the Bodies) says that whilst growing up, the devil was a vital presence in her own life and so it was only natural that he should feature in her novels. In this specially commissioned talk, she traces the footsteps of the devil in her life, her fiction and in today's world.

This talk has been rescheduled from Autumn 2012 and includes live music from violinist David le Page.

Following the release of his critically acclaimed debut album 'My Friend Marx' in 2011, Marc O'Reilly has established himself as one of the most exciting artists within the folk/blues genre gaining comparisons with artists such as John Martyn and Bon Iver.

2013 saw Marc tour all over Europe including appearances at major festivals like Glastonbury, Electric Picnic and Boardmasters and squeezing in a trip to the US to appear at the Live in the Vineyard Festival in Napa, California.

His alter-ego side project with his brother Pierre, the electro-pop duo 'R', recently receieved excellent radio support for their debut single 'Change' from tastemakers such as Steve Lamacq (BBC 6music), Janice Long (BBC Radio 2) and Paul Mcloone (Today FM).

As if that wasn't enough to keep him busy, Marc has also provided vocals on 3 tracks for the new album by MOBO winning act Karios 4tet which was recorded at Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios, has received 4 star reviews from Mojo, The Independent and Guardian and has led to the recording of a live BBC Maida Vale session for the Jamie Cullum Show on Radio 2.

Hoop learned to sing at an early age, harmonising with her musical Mormon family in northern California. She began writing highly idiosyncratic songs at the age of 14 to keep her company on her long walks to school. At 16, Hoop broke away from her strict upbringing and began what she calls her 'life as a racoon', off the grid & close to nature. Rambling through the high mountain deserts of the Southwest and along the coastlines of the Northwest, she worked as a wilderness survival guide and chalked up skills in farming, surveying, and carpentry. Her songwriting continued throughout, shared on porches, in deep river canyons and around campfires.

In 2004 the desire to share these songs on a broader scale set in. She settled in Los Angeles, where she honed her songwriting craft and developed a reputation as a unique and beguiling live performer of real substance. Though she now resides in Manchester, England, Hoop returned to Los Angeles to record her third album, The House That Jack Built.

Jesca has quite the growing collection of fans in high places: Tom Waits described her music as being "like a four sided coin. She is an old soul, like a black pearl, a good witch or red moon. Her music is like going swimming in a lake at night". Peter Gabriel took her to South America to sing with him, and in recent years she has been hand picked to play as support on tour for Eels, Andrew Bird, Punch Brothers and Elbow: Elbow's Guy Garvey even had her do a stint as guest presenter on his BBC radio show in early 2012, to great reception.]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[1529]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[The Brudenell Social Club]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[4204]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[Brudenell Social Club]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[10 Apr 2014 7:30pm]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10186.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10186.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[9300]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Pascal And Ami Roge]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[Debussy & Ravel's music for four hands

'Spellbinding' The Sunday Telegraph

The Roges are dedicated ambassadors for French music. They have played across the world, sharing their love of Debussy, Ravel and the other great Gallic pioneers, and they continue to arrange French orchestral music for the special possibilities of four hands.

As Opera North prepares to open La Boheme, a vision of Paris dreamed by an Italian, this is the perfect moment to immerse ourselves in the music of the great French Impressionist composers.

The Roge's stunning rendition will include Ravel's Rhapsodie Espagnole and Sonatine, while Debussy's La Mer concludes our French evening.]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[1026]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[Howard Assembly Room]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[4191]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[Howard Assembly Room]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[10 Apr 2014 7:45pm]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/9300.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/9300.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[9472]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Tommy Smith And Brian Kellock]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[Seven Arts is a lovely venue for small intimate music and so we are really looking forward to a sax and piano combination featuring two of Scotland's most famous jazz artists, saxophonist Tommy Smith and pianist Brian Kellock who will be teaming up to bring you a beautiful and imaginative jazz.

CUD were initially lauded for their quirky Peel session cover of 'You Sexy Thing' in 1987.

This led to a major-label deal with A&M in 1991, front-page NME coverage, massive sellout gigs and proper Top 30 hits, 'Rich and Strange' and 'Purple Love Balloon'.

Misunderstood by record companies and press, CUD packed away their guitars and sticks in 1995 but, bolstered by a greatest hits anthology ('Rich and Strange') in 2006, they agreed to tread the boards again and found an army of 'Space CUDets' still eager to sing along, dance like fruitcakes and invade their stage.

In 2012, CUD reunited with their original guitarist and key songwriter, Mike Dunphy, and the result is their first new material in 18 years, the perky 7" and download single 'Louise' b/w 'Mexico'.

They are now celebrating their 50th Anniversary by recording their first original album in 27 years - a mixture of vintage rock & roll songs and new renditions of their own rockney classics. The album also features special guest stars such as Jools Holland and Hugh Laurie.

They reached the top twenty in 1979 with Gertcha, which became a nationwide catchphrase. This was followed by Rabbit, which reached No. 8 in the charts, and a No. 2 record Ain't No Pleasing You in 1982. In 1986 they had a top six record with Snooker Loopy.

Watt is often cited as a key figure in the development of American alternative rock; The Red Hot Chili Peppers dedicated their hugely successful Blood Sugar Sex Magik to Watt. Throughout his career he has been known for his inventive, melodic playing; and thoroughly distinctive basslines.

Watt is a cultural omnivore. Especially over the last decade, his openness (and eagerness) to devour new musical experience has become increasingly audible (and visible) in the dozens of projects and live performances he's participated in with artists as divergent as Yoko Ono, Black Moth Super Rainbow, Petra Haden, Kelly Clarkson, Thurston Moore, Porno For Pyros, Nels Cline, Stephen Hodges (Tom Waits), J Mascis, Tony Maimone (Pere Ubu), Yuko Araki and Hirotaka 'Shimmy' Shimizu (Cornelius), Dougie Bowne (Lounge Lizards) and many more.

As always, Watt persists in exceeding, defying and confounding musical (and other) expectations: the truly romantic embodiment of an authentic punk rocker.]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[1529]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[The Brudenell Social Club]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[4204]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[Brudenell Social Club]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[16 Apr 2014 7:30pm]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10187.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10187.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[10188]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Northside]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[Northside followed the Hacienda heyday in 1991 with the release of their acclaimed UK Top 20 album 'Chicken Rhythms' on Factory Records.

Influenced by reggae, punk, and psychedelia, the band were invited to open the first night of the Great British Music Weekend in January 1991 at Wembley Arena, broadcast live over three nights on Radio One. Despite pleas from the station not to play their first single, Shall We Take A Trip? the band started with this number, causing the station to stop its live broadcast for several minutes. Opening for The Happy Mondays and The La's at Elland Road in Leeds on 1st June 1991, they were named by many, including the music monthlies, as the highlight of the day.

Now back together again the four original members of Northside (Paul Walsh - Drums, Tim Walsh- Guitar, Cliff Ogier - Bass and Warren Dermody - Vocals/Lyrics) have big plans for next year!

The acclaimed Leeds based chamber choir presents the work - one of the supreme achievements in classical music - in Leeds Minster on Friday 18 April 2014 at 7.00 pm. 

The Singers first presented Bach's masterpiece here at the Minster in 1985 as part of the celebrations of the Tercentenary of the great composer's birth, and has performed the work many times since, including, memorably at Leeds Town Hall in 1991 in celebration of the 150th anniversary of the consecration of Leeds Parish Church in 1841.

Music Director of St Peter's Singers, Dr Simon Lindley, said:
'It can be said that no single musical work is greater than Bach's Mass in B minor; the glorious sonorities of the piece include wonderful settings of the sections of the Creed dealing with the suffering, death, burial and Resurrection of Jesus, making a performance on Good Friday an especially compelling experience.'

They are a cult musical phenomenon with more than 10 years of international touring, multiple studio records and a fan base of fervent punk, soul, free jazz and garage rock heads.

King Khan, the spiritual guru and front man, cobbled together a fierce line-up of musicians while in Berlin in between reading Tarot cards and raising a family. What he ended up with in 1999 is one of the most entertaining groups the world has seen and heard since the days of Ike & Tina. The line-up includes Chicago-born, Ron Streeter (veteran percussionist for Curtis Mayfield, Stevie Wonder), a horn section consisting of trumpeter Simon Wojan (member of Kranky Records recording artists Cloudland Canyon), tenor sax man Torben Wesche (Germany's John Coltrane), and famous French rockabilly baritone saxophonist Frederic Brissaud.

The Rezillos burst forth upon the rock scene in 1976, having gathered together at Edinburgh College of Art. Through a shared love of Sixties Garage Rock and the Spectoresque Girl Group glam of The Ronettes and The Shangri-Las, The Rezillos found themselves inadvertently caught up in the Punk or New Wave movement. Their debut single, "I Can't Stand My Baby", shot them to underground fame initially via airings on John Peel's radio show. Their classic singles "My Baby Does Good Sculptures", "Top of the Pops" and "Destination Venus" signalled critically acclaimed milestones for the band.

Their landmark album of 1978 "Can't Stand the Rezillos" reached the top 10 in the UK album chart. They appeared twice on the legendary Old Grey Whistle Test and hit the Top Twenty with their hit single 'Top of the Pops', a satirical swipe at the UK pop music programme of the same name. Once the band had achieved chart success it was inevitable that they should appear on the same show! They followed up that same year with a live recording, "Mission Accomplished... But the Beat Goes On", and promptly broke up to the anguish of fans and music critics alike.]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[1529]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[The Brudenell Social Club]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[4204]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[Brudenell Social Club]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[20 Apr 2014 7:00pm]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10190.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10190.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[9370]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Eddi Reader]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[Eddi Reader was brought into the limelight with Fairground Attraction and their single Perfect and parent album First of a Million Kisses which both topped the British charts.  However, it has been her subsequent solo albums which signalled her increasing ability to assimilate different musical styles and make them all very much her own.  From the traditional to the contemporary, Eddi brings to joyous life all forms of song and what sets Reader apart is the depth and quality of the emotional performance;  her ability not only to move the listener but to connect her experience to that of her audience.  Her rare blend of meltingly true vocals and towering romanticism combine with an astute and pragmatic nature to make her a unique and powerful figure in contemporary British music.

The new School Of Language is called Old Fears and it's set for release on Memphis Industries on 7 April 2014.

Old Fears. It's a pop record. A place of clipped falsetto, melancholic funk, iridescent electro, shimmering post-punk, futurist prog. A self-contained sphere of strange sensations. Beguiling textures. Lengthening shadows. At times it is both liminal and minimal, at others emotive and external. Ambiguous and ambient. Tantalising and tempered. Modern. Unique. And funny too. "I wrote a lot of notes and they seemed to distinctly split into things to do with love and things to do with fear," says David Brewis. "A lot of it has ended up with me looking back at when I was 19, 20 - my formative years. So though I wouldn't want to call it a concept album it's definitely themed."]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[1529]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[The Brudenell Social Club]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[4204]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[Brudenell Social Club]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[26 Apr 2014 7:30pm]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10191.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10191.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[10398]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Crispy Ambulance]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[Alan Hempsall and Robert Davenport formed Crispy Ambulance in Manchester in 1977, originally as a two-man outfit, adding two further members, Keith Darbyshire and Gary Madeley, to the line-up in the following year.

Formed in Osaka 33 years ago the trio rose from humble DIY beginnings to joining Nirvana on their 'Nevermind' tour and trailblazing a path for women in music and inspiring legions of bands. Favourites of Kurt Cobain, John Peel, Thurston Moore, Marc Riley, Gideon Coe, Radcliffe & Maconie, Jonathon Ross & Dan Hegarty the band are arguably the most influential and beloved Japanese rock export.

Live, they are a tight rock machine punching out fast, highly exciting sets of Punk, Pop, Rock & Metal hits coated with a unique life affirming quirky magic that as they fast approach their 1000th gig, shows no signs of fading. As Naoko says 'Let's Rock!'

"When I finally got to see them live, I was transformed into a hysterical nine-year-old girl at a Beatles concert."Kurt Cobain

Music OMH: 8/10 "For an incredible 31 years Shonen Knife have been pumping out prototype riot grrrl, thrashing together early punk sounds with pop melodies."

Michell Plum (Waking The Witch, Chumbawamba) and Nick Hall (The Hall Brothers) "draw inspiration from very eclectic sources including Nick Lowe, Scott Walker, Ian McNabb, Guy Clark, Kate Bush, Aimee Mann, Everly Brothers, Johnny Cash & June Carter, Chumbawamba and Show of Hands - and they bring all these influences into a sound that is clearly their own, based on powerfully-played acoustic instruments, perfect harmonies and meaningful songs." (bio) 

Whatever the analysis, they're fantastic live, so we jumped at the chance of a show on the album tour. Title track Thundercloud can be heard and downloaded on Bandcamp.

Support comes from Jonny Walker, who has been on the LAAH "to book list" since Mike attended one of his Citizens' Kazoo Orchestra protests in Camden last autumn. A professional busker who has only relatively recently started playing traditional gigs whilst continuing to perform on the streets across the UK and Europe, his 2012 debut EP 'This Is Not Me' was described as "Heartfelt, unpretentious and utterly charming" by Rocksucker and Jonny himself has been called mix of Dylan, Neil Young and the enigmatic Leonard Cohen. He is a natural storyteller with lyrics that challenge the depths.

http://www.jonnywalker.co.uk/

Alongside performing Jonny is an activist, founding grassroots advocacy body ASAP! (Association of Street Artists and Performers) and has been featured on BBC and ITV news, The Guardian and extensive local publications, for his ongoing campaign to overturn local and national government policies that place arbitrary restrictions on street music and damage the cultural lives of our towns and cities. He is the Founding Director of the Keep Streets Live Campaign for public spaces that are open to grassroots music and art. In Liverpool, York and Camden he has led public opposition to council policies that stifle street culture. The Live At All Hallows team are pleased to be able to do our bit to help support this important campaign.

Bangerz has been getting rave reviews including Entertainment Weekly calling it "...utterly fresh, a pop blitz from a hip-hop blueprint, and proof that Miley won't settle for just shocking us." US Weekly declared it "the year's most titillating pop explosion" awarding the album "4 stars (out of 4)."

With more than 20 major awards to its credit, including the Oscar winning film version starring Madonna and Antonio Banderas, Evita features some of the most iconic songs in musical theatre, including Don't Cry For Me Argentina, On This Night of a Thousand Stars, You Must Love Me, and Another Suitcase in Another Hall.

Marti Pellow plays Che, a character who reflects the voice of the Argentine people; linked to Eva by destiny he brings conflict to the story of Eva's rise to fame.

As a solo-singer, recording artist, and at the beginning of his career with Wet Wet Wet, Marti Pellow has enjoyed virtually un-rivalled chart success, with over 25 hits and three of the UK's biggest number one singles, including the seminal Love Is All Around. He has performed all over the world, and his West End and Musical Theatre appearances include The Witches of Eastwick, Chess, Jekyll & Hyde, Chicago and Blood Brothers. He rejoins the cast of EVITA fresh from an arena tour with Wet Wet Wet.

This production introduces a new star, Madalena Alberto, bringing the role of Eva to life to incredible critical acclaim. Madalena's musical theatre credits include the role of Piaf at the Curve Theatre, Leicester, Fantine in the 25th Anniversary production of Les Miserables. Other roles include Lucy in Jekyll and Hyde (Union Theatre, London), Carmen Diaz in Fame (UK Tour), Sam in Over the Threshold (Edinburgh and London) and Sonia in Godspell (Union Theatre, London). The Portuguese singer-songwriter also released her album Heart Condition in 2012.

Why can't we just go out and sing them?" complains Neil Innes, aka Ron Nasty of The Rutles. "Maybe we could call it "Rutalot", suggests John Halsey, aka Barry Wom, the "noisy one" of the so-called "Pre-Fab Four". BRAND ON THE RUN! It all began 35 years ago when Eric Idle of Monty Python persuaded Neil Innes, of the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band, to join him in a comedy series for BBC 2 called Rutland Weekend Television - all about a spoof TV station, the smallest in Britain, churning out really cheap programmes on a shoestring.
 
Low budget? More like No Budget!
 
Innes suggested to Idle that they could do a send-up of A Hard Day's Night, the Beatles first movie. "It's in Black and White, it's speeded up, and we could wear wigs and tight trousers and run around a field somewhere..." "Great!" Exclaimed Idle. "I've got a sketch about a man making a documentary who's so boring, the camera runs away from him..."
 
And so the name "Rutles" was born. But no one could have expected what happened next. A year later, such was the enormous pressure on the Beatles to get back together again, the one-off clip was shown in the USA - on NBC's flagship satire programme: "Saturday Night Live". It was a sensation. Thousands of people wrote in. Mailbags were bulging. So were the trousers! Everyone got the joke. Lorne Michaels, the producer, believed the whole Beatles story could now be told - as "The Rutles". NBC agreed and gave him the money. Eric Idle quickly came up with the title: "All You Need Is Cash - the story of the Pre-Fab Four". Bill Murray, John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd got involved - so did George Harrison, who brought in Mick Jagger and Paul Simon.
 
"Last time was just the last time. This time it really is the last time." Innes recalls: "I can clearly remember it all. I was sitting to one side, on a window sill in an executive office, high up in the Rockefeller Centre in New York, listening to all this when suddenly everyone started looking at me. Lorne asked if I could write 20 more Rutle songs by next Thursday lunchtime. I said I would try!" A second album, "Archaeology", with Mickey Simmonds (Keyboards) and "Rutle" Ricky Fataar (Stig O Hara) on drums, was released in 1996 - to even greater acclaim. Planned to coincide with the Beatles "Anthology" - by public demand - new songs like "Questionnaire" and "Don't Know Why" were more thoughtful and less of a parody - or as George Harrison sweetly put it - "all part of the soup". About 10 years ago, Neil, John and Mickey teamed up with Mark Griffiths on Bass and Ken Thornton on lead guitar, (Ken can almost replace the irreplaceable Ollie Halsall!) and played the Rutle songs live, on stage, in front of teabag throwing devotees, in village halls and at weddings, oh yes, and Glastonbury.
 
"It's not a career move," explains Innes, "but over the years we have become a "Brand" - and that makes some people very proprietorial."
"Pro what?" demands the man who was Barry Wom.
"Pro Prietor. You know - Legal Owner?" says Nasty the adjective.
"Oh. I'll keep quiet then."
"No, no - you can still hit the drums..."
 
 
"Making Rutle music is supposed to be fun, and it IS fun - but someone usually goes and spoils it all by saying something stupid like you can't do this or you can't say that and by laying down the law."
Innes continues with his beef, "with any luck by the time they get round to suing us we'll have disbanded again!"
"Why don't we just call it "Rutalot?" mutters the Noisy One...]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[1043]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[City Varieties]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[1252]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[City Varieties]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[16 May 2014 7:30pm]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10376.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10376.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[10250]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Stackridge]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[Stackridge formed in the early '70s, touring the UK, building a fanatical following and released 3 albums on MCA, "Stackridge", "Friendliness" and in 1974 "The Man in the Bowler Hat", which was produced by George Martin. This triumphant masterpiece, regarded by many to be George Martin's finest creation outside of his Beatles canon, the band recorded two more critically acclaimed albums, "Extravaganza" and "Mr. Mick" for Elton John's Rocket label.

Going their separate ways in 1976, they continued to make music. James Warren and Andy Davies gained notable success as electro-pop balladeers, The Korgis with two hit singles including the massive "Everybody's Got To Learn Sometime".

In 2006 the still devoted followers of the band were delighted when a reformed Stackridge started played a series of gigs, that included classic songs from the large back catalogue and a body of outstanding new material.

As ever, Stackridge has brought its' effervescent mix of melodic tunes, playful and poignant lyrics and instrumental exploration to their first album release on Helium Records. "A Victory For Common Sense", produced by Chris Hughes sees original members Andy Davis, "Mutter" Slater, "Crun" Walter and James Warren back together again and in truly fine form.]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[1529]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[The Brudenell Social Club]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[4204]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[Brudenell Social Club]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[16 May 2014 7:45pm]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10250.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10250.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[9255]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[West Side Story]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[No.1 'greatest musical of all time'

There has not been a single decade in which Albert has not written multiple hits songs since he scored his first hit with Little Arrows at the age of 24. His songs have been responsible for the sale of over 360 million records worldwide including over 30 chart-topping hits. Many of his most beloved songs, like The Air That I Breathe and When I Need You, have become hits multiple times with various artists, decade after decade.

Albert's songs have repeatedly topped the international pop, R&B, country, adult contemporary and Latin charts, sometimes simultaneously. Included among these are the #1 hits When I Need You, Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now (nominated for an Oscar, Golden Globe and Grammy), One Moment in Time, and To All the Girls I've Loved Before.

Now after over 50 years of his successful career he recorded his first live album ever. Songbook 2013 was recorded in Wilhelmshaven, Germany during his recent SONGBOOK Tour, one very special night, a night that catches the hilarious moment between a stunning performer and his audience. Wilhelmshaven is a sleepy country town in Germany. Albert Hammond says "People who live on the country side really appreciate that IÂ´m coming into town to perform for them, you can feel it and that makes it very special for me."

The Live Double CD with over 30 classical songs of Albert Hammond is a testament of an outstanding singer and performer, it proves his fantastic skills as an entertainer who collaborates with his audience.

HYPNOSIS DISPLAY

'The music of Grouper creates a feeling that can only be defined as awe, an uncanny mixture of wonder and dread that nobody does better' Pitchfork

A new FILMusic commission by Opera North, HYPNOSIS DISPLAY is a meditation on contemporary America in sound and image. Portland based musician Grouper (Liz Harris) juxtaposes layers of processed field recording, choral vocal harmony and keyboard in a resonant framework that moves behind and through Paul Clipson's 16mm film. Clipson's densely rhythmical images in turn traverse Grouper's musical language to create startling, revelatory, and critical associations.

Together they invite the audience to participate in a collective mind's-eye trip through landscapes of American myth making, including: the west coast, the worker, the city and the street.

An original soundtrack devised and played by Musical Arc will accompany the performance led by Lorraine Cowburn as artistic director. Using ground breaking techniques and a multiscreen set, the production will merge shadow and dance; dancers will become shadow puppets, puppets will become dancers in a seamless fusion between what is in front, and, behind the screens.

Their debut single "The Murder Of Liddle Towers" was self-released in 1978 and then picked up by Rough Trade and went on to sell many thousands of copies. It told the story of a boxing coach who was killed while in police custody and is one of the most incendiary punk 45s ever released. Even today it sounds incredible, dripping with anger, and its less than polished production being perfect. The B-side "Police Oppression" was also a brilliant track and singer Thomas "Mensi" Mensforth still gets harrassed from the police who have never forgiven him for these tunes.

Critical acclaim led the band to sign a major label deal and the release of their second single "I'm An Upstart". Once again this was a blistering piece of UK punk that hasn't lost its intensity over thirty years later. The band eventually received mainstream success with their third effort "Teenage Warning", which got them on Top Of The Pops and was to be their biggest hit. Over thirty years after their greatest anthems were released, the songs of the Angelic Upstarts take on a new resonance in these times of global recession and rising unemployment, not to mention the UK continuing to be involved in imperial adventures overseas. These tunes are arguably far more relevant than anything The Clash or The Sex Pistols ever put out. The Upstarts might have lacked a certain level of finesse but their integrity was never in doubt.]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[1529]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[The Brudenell Social Club]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[4204]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[Brudenell Social Club]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[20 Jun 2014 7:00pm]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10251.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10251.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[10380]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Joe Longthorne]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[This talented artist began his career over three decades ago with appearances on Junior Showtime, followed by a grounding on the tough Northern club circuit.
