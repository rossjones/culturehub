One of Leeds' most successful monthly literary events will take part in this year's LitFest. Following appearances from national poets such as Michael Symmons Roberts and Helen Mort, not-for-profit Words on Tap will invite emerging local wordsmiths from the city to take part in an open-mic showcase. 

The Chemic Tavern is one Leeds's most celebrated public houses, providing the ideal setting for an informal evening of verse and drink. Always a warm response from the audience and decent pint in the glass, this is a perfect opportunity for any poets wanting to try out new material or take their first steps onto the spoken word stage.

The Words on Tap ethos is very simple: to promote the region's poets and support local pubs, while introducing and promoting free poetry events to audiences that both would and would not ordinarily be interested. We may bend our own rules from time to time depending on the opportunities that should come our way, but these are our main aims - free art in an environment that nurtures it!]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[1810]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[The Chemic Tavern]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[14 Mar 2014 7:30pm - 11:00pm]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10133.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10133.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[9925]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Stupid Women]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[Stupid Women is a live directed improvisation. It aims to combine idiocy with skill, anarchy with meaning and costumes with music. A number of guests, of high calibre and low pay, attempt the possible and quite probably fail.

Stupid Women is an endeavour made especially for Juncture as a tribute to the late and great Nigel Charnock whose piece Stupid Men irritated and annoyed most audiences that saw it.

We are hoping to be able to achieve something similar.

Stupid Women will have been created at Yorkshire Dance over four days by Wendy Houstoun with Jo Fong, TC Howard, Sophie Unwin, Vivien Wood and others.

You take it and then notice that everyone else in the room has begun holding hands too. A man starts to speak. He says:
"Hello everybody, my name is..."
Moving through moments of playful interaction, participation and celebration, We Used To Wait explores what it means to be 'live' and present together in an increasingly digital world. We Used To Wait invites its audience to question why falling asleep on a stranger's shoulder, playing a spontaneous game and feeling the wind of someone run past you might be important.
A rectangle of chairs. Audience and performers sat side by side. No set. Just us together. And a gentle invitation to interact...
"Here I am. Here we are. Here we go."

We are hosting a rehearsed reading of the script, written by Yorkshire based poet Ian McMillan. There is an original score performed live with singing.

"On the blood dark sea the ship is barely moving 
There's a sail as torn as a shattered shirt 
Something is aboard the ship..."

Nosferatu tells the dark and mysterious tale of the sailors in Bram Stokers novel Dracula, as they journey from Varna to Whitby with an unknown cargo.

This is a fantastic chance to be one of the first to see a new groundbreaking piece of theatre, feeding into the shaping and impression of the play, which will embark on a national tour in 2015. We need your feedback so please join us for an evening of blood, danger and art! 

Proper Job Theatre Company is based in the North of England creating and touring new work as well as large-scale theatre events. Proper Job are passionate about continuously developing projects that excite us, fire our curiosity and expand our imagination. ]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[304]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[Carriageworks Theatre]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[20 Mar 2014 7:30pm]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/9905.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/9905.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[9246]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Wrong 'Un: A Suffragette's Story]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[Presented by Red Ladder Theatre Company

Why? Patriotism? Heroism? A death wish, maybe? 

In Theatre of the Dales' script-in-hand production, Leeds playwrights Stuart Fortey and Peter Spafford explore the motives of Wilfred Owen and Edward Thomas. Neither man survived. What they wrote undoubtedly did.

On Scarborough Front by Stuart Fortey is a short two hander where Owen clashes with a retired colonel in a hotel being used as an officers' mess. As his own son is reported missing, the colonel is bitter and critical towards the young Owen who appears to have found a safe niche as Catering Secretary. But as the play develops, the men grow to a deeper understanding. The son survives, while Owen returns to the front, not for motives of patriotism, but to spur himself to write again. (The Clarence Gardens Hotel, now the Clifton, still stands on North Bay.)

The Edge of the Forest by Peter Spafford has two time scales. A brother and sister now own a house cluttered with war memorabilia - their father's legacy. She wants to sell up, he wants to cling to the past. In fact he has recently become agoraphobic after a mugging incident. The arrival of an estate agent with an eye for the sister pushes things to a climax. The boy is obsessed by Thomas. For long stretches he identifies with him in his mind, imagining his sister and the agent as Edward's wife Helen and their friend the charming and persuasive Robert Frost. Edward, like him, is torn between staying where he is and venturing forth into action.

For Infamous, a more 'personal' show, Derren is re-united with his close collaborator and friend, actor/writer Andy Nyman.
 
Derren says 'Now we've joined forces again, we're very eager to make this show feel different. There was something of a template we followed with all the shows, which worked very well. It's rather exciting and scary leaving that behind. This one should certainly have a different tone, and will mix things up a bit for those who have seen the others on TV or live'.
 
Infamous is Derren's sixth show since 2003. He has toured every year since then and has been watched by an estimated audience of over 2 million people. He has won two prestigious Olivier Awards, for Something Wicked This Way Comes (2006) and Svengali (2012), and confesses that touring is still his favourite thing to do.

Whether 'home' means a back-to-back terraced house, a tent pitched in a bit of wasteland, or an abandoned rocket on the surface of the moon, Fictions invites you to riff off real or imaginary dwellings past or present. 

Our invited speakers at this event are: 

ZODWA NYONI Zimbabwean-born poet and playwright, who has held residencies at BBC Radio Leeds and at the Ilkley Literature Festival, Zodwa was recently named one of Leeds' 20 best writers under 40, and is certainly one of Fictions' favourite poets. Don't miss this opportunity to see her in action!

NASSER HUSSAIN Nasser is looking forward to the forthcoming publication of his first collection of spoken word poems, entitled 'boldface' - available this summer from Burning Eye Press. In the meantime he teaches literature and creative writing at Leeds Metropolitan University, and is currently at work on something completely different. 

Music at this event will come from DAVID BROAD.

OPEN MIC. There will be a writers' open mic, at which contributions of flash fiction, short fiction, true stories, and excerpts of larger work will all be welcome. You MUST keep your contributions under 6 minutes because if you go over, YOU WILL BE STOPPED. Even in the middle of a sentence if it comes to it. Please practise reading your work out to check that it comes in under 6 minutes - we're taking the very un-Fictions-like step of being firm about this.

The Passion follows very much in the traditions of Stainer [The Crucifixion of 1887] and Maunder [Olivet to Calvary of 1904]. 

The passion narrative unfolds mainly in recitative drawn from Gospel texts, while solo arias and "choral meditations", with words probably by Somervell himself, reflect on the action. As in the Stainer and Maunder pieces, there are hymns for all to sing. Somervell's music is throughout reflective and beautiful and at times exquisite.

"It is, truly, a forgotten masterpiece," said conductor Dr Simon Lindley, "I remember obtaining a copy some years ago from a colleague who was organist of Holy Trinity Church in Boar Lane, and have been wanting for decades to give the piece an airing. The centenary year of its first performance provides us with an excellent opportunity!"]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[4897]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[Leeds Minster]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[6327]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[St Peter's Singers]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[30 Mar 2014 6:30pm - 8:00pm]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/9728.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/9728.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[9403]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[The Wizard of Oz ]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[Click your heels, clap your hands and go Over the Rainbow with this fantastic production of The Wizard of Oz.

A tale full of comedy, bad ideas and dead comics that uses puppetry, physical theatre and shadow play to create its inventive and farcical world.

Each ghost rider, bike and dancer wears a bespoke LED light suit that changes colour, flash-rate and luminosity as the Peloton changes course. The combined results produce mesmerising light patterns as the cyclists interact with their passing surroundings, culminating in a public performance and film projection as night falls in central Leeds.

Both as large-scale public art and through the powerful film and photography it will inspire, the work allows us to see the body in perfect motion and to look again at familiar environments. The landscape of Yorkshire from remote moor to urban heartland becomes an open canvas carrying a new visual language seen in live performance and a documentary film by renowned cycling film director Mark Huskisson.

Ghost Peloton builds on the worldwide success of NVA's Speed of Light which since 2012 has choreographed massed endurance runners in sites as diverse as Arthur's Seat, Yokohama docks and the Ruhr valley. Ghost Peloton is a collaboration between NVA and Leeds based Phoenix Dance Theatre in association with Sustrans.]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[7775]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[The Tetley ]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[16 May 2014 - 17 May 2014]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10024.png]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10024.png]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[9671]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Leeds Gilbert And Sullivan Society Gala Charity Performance: Trial by Jury]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[by W S Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan

Northern Ballet dancers stunned audiences when they performed Hans van Manen's Concertante last year. This sensational piece, inspired by and set to Frank Martin's Petite Symphonie Concertante, returns by popular demand.
Described by the New York Times as "one of the ten best choreographers in the world", the final piece will be by Tony Award nominated Lar Lubovitch who has created more than 100 dance works.

Book, Music and Lyrics by Benjamin Till
To commemorate the centenary of the outbreak of the Great War NYMT has commissioned a new work from Benjamin Till. The story follows a group of Leeds residents from the start of the war until the battle of the Somme in 1916. The men, members of an amateur brass band, join up to the Leeds Pals regiment and their womenfolk decide to learn the instruments that the men have left behind to keep the spirit of the brass band alive and to play for them when they triumphantly return to the city after the war. We watch the women trying to learn the brass instruments whilst the men simply try to stay alive. It is an epic musical about love and survival.

The Rock 'n' Roll Pantos are hugely popular and are fast becoming a Leeds tradition. The incredible atmosphere has audiences dancing in the aisles.
 
The City Varieties' Rock 'n' Roll Panto has everything you would expect from a traditional family pantomime - slapstick comedy, audience interaction and outlandish costumes -  with the bonus of  a rocking soundtrack and the now-legendary 'boulder fight'.
 
The soundtrack is played live on stage by the extraordinarily talented cast - you won't see anything like this anywhere in Yorkshire. It's a real treat.
