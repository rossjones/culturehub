Give Us Our Daily Dance

"Five years ago I became interested in developing a daily practice to support and maintain training and help elevate my performance and choreographic work. So I set myself the task of dancing everyday, when I say dancing I mean it in the truest sense. Unleashing an internal force, re-connecting with the feelings and ideas that encouraged me to dance in the first place.

"The class will consist of guided exercises,  departure points and lots of flamboyant dancing. We will cultivate a playground of possibilities, discover new forms that collide and stretch our limitations."

The focus to the 6 weeks differs for each course, exploring artists, movements and current exhibitions.

In general terms the emphasis for drawing will be learning to 'look' with a series of drawing exercises in measurement, proportions, compositions and shade and tone.

Acrylic paints will be used as our painting medium.

Hayden's Sifting focuses on the body as a 'total instrument', capable of what can be called the 'total act', working on physical actions, movement as theatrical act, and the voice.

A series of physical exercises will establish a strong, vital body-breath connection, unlocking the flow of living impulses within the body, allowing our attention, intention and awareness to flow more freely.

Specific 'impossible' tasks will allow our inner 'obstacles' to become more transparent. Dealing with the element of physical risk or danger, these tasks emphasize our apparent limitations and give us the chance to go beyond them.

We will compositionally combine movement, voice and text to develop our own individual 'score' within which to work. We will focus on relationships between precision and organicity, awareness of space and one's ability to react to its constituent elements, improvisation within a structure as well as dramaturgical elaboration.

By harnessing creative energy in a more present, active and alive manner, the act of creating can then develop within a more structured or compositional frame. Participants will be asked to create a score of actions between 3-5 minutes in length with a clear beginning, middle and end. We will be focusing on its logic, actions, intentions, meaning and content.

This workshop is open to both amateur and professional performers, pedagogues and directors.

We are looking for people who enjoy singing to take part in a 10 week choir project. No experience is necessary but enthusiasm is essential!

There are many things we take for granted about the place we live in - and what is familiar to one person may be surprising to someone else. 365 Leeds Stories is a way of sharing our experience of the city in a creative and informal way.

Since September 2013, Leeds-based artists Matthew Bellwood and Alison Andrews have been working together with a range of people who live, work or seek residence in Leeds on the creation of series of maps of the city; maps that tell stories and make connections between the people who live there. They have been rendered in different forms - expressed in textiles, written in stories, floated down the river or rendered as conventional cartographic representations, albeit with a twist.

In November and December, we ran two day-long workshops with composer James Redwood. These were open to anyone in the city who wanted to come along and join in. We spent the first day getting to know each other and sharing ideas, thoughts, feelings and impressions of the city, before settling down to write some lyrics that we felt summed up our experiences of living in Leeds. The material we created was quite diverse - quirky, poetic and sometimes slightly sinister. By the end of the first day, we felt we had the basis for three different songs.

The following week, we worked with James to set the songs to music. James led us in a series of warm-ups, which got us on our feet and singing together and then helped us to find our way into the songs, deciding on a tone and mood for each one, pulling out melodies and rhythms from the group and shaping the resultant material. He then took the pieces away with him to polish up and score.

From 24th February onwards, we'll be working with vocal animateur Caroline Challis to bring these songs to life, with a view to singing them at the opening of the project exhibition in Leeds Central Library on 3rd May.

Rehearsals will be at the Central Library on Monday evenings (6.15pm - 7.45pm) from 24th February.]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[476]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[Leeds Central Library]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[10019]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[365 Leeds Stories]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[24 Feb 2014 - 28 Apr 2014]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10020.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10020.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[9374]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Complete Beginners Taichi Course]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[Start the spring by detoxing your body, de -stressing your mind and revitalising your spirit.

Her crocheted street art makes cheeky visual statements that offer a new reading of the towns and cities we travel through and the monuments and street furniture we pass by. For the Grand Depart, Cassandra is creating ten woolly bikes for a year-long trail connecting ten towns with the many knitters, crocheters and yarn-stormers that have taken part.

Drawing inspiration from iconic Yorkshire themes including the landscape of the Dales, Yorkshire's textile mills, literary heroines and heroes, and the iconic flat cap, each bike gets a woolly makeover using local yarn. Most of the yarn is the produce of Yorkshire sheep, but one special batch comes from a collection of reclaimed saris. The transformed knitted vehicles will go on display in Sheffield this July, before they take up individual positions along the trail route.  

Workshops take place between January and June at festivals and venues across the region and are open to anyone with a basic ability of crocheting.  ]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[395]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[West Yorkshire Playhouse]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[12 Mar 2014 - 19 Mar 2014]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10025.png]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10025.png]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[9435]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Creative 10:  Art And Design At Union105]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[A 10 week general art and design course that will help you develop a range of creative skills using a specific theme as a starting point for making work and exploring your own ideas.

Three monthly sessions. The series offers a compact survey of Jacob Ross' immensely popular and highly regarded technical creative approach to crafting fiction. His very successful course has been running for more than fifteen years. Many beginning writers developed and fine-tuned their writing skills in his course, to the point where their work has been shortlisted in major competitions, or won prizes.

Narrative Drive is for writers who want to maximise the quality and impact of their work. At the end of the series you will have a better awareness of your own strengths and weakness as a writer and the steps you need to take to address them. We will examine the building blocks of stories and how they work together to produce strong memorable narratives.

The series will expose you to the very best examples of modern fiction from which you can learn and refine your skills. Your knowledge of contemporary themes and styles will be enhanced. This course is for advanced writers already working on their novel-in-progress or their collection of short stories. You will be required to submit work in advance of the course.]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[8638]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[TBC]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[1638]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[INSCRIBE & Peepal Tree Press]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[18 Jan 2014 - 15 Mar 2014]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/8639.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/8639.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[10494]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Matt Roberts Arts: Open Forum 2014]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[The aim of Open Forum 2014 is to allow Matt Roberts Arts to use their experience to provide advice to artists in regions where the commercial sector is developing and less visible.

anyone needing hospital treatment
anyone trying to rent a house, open a bank account or get a driving licence will have to show proof of their immigration status.
anyone who doesn't look 'British'

It is an attempt to legalise the harassment witnessed last summer with the hateful 'go home' campaign and the stop checks in London.

Before you set out on a journey it helps to know where you're going. If not, you're going to end up SOMEWHERE . . . just not where you want to be.

What if your elusive dreams took shape before your eyes? What would you discover? What could you then bring into your life for real?

Vision boards are a fabulous technique for focussing our energy and commitment on what's important. Then we get to have more of it in our lives. Pictures, words, photos, lines from poems, colour - they all help to create a powerful reminder of what you want in your future.

Making them in a workshop is fun, playful, stress free and collaborative. You get to share ideas and tell other people about yours. That's the added extra of doing this with others - you get to say it out loud as well.

"I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I lived just the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well." Diane Ackerman

This workshop will suit anyone who is
- Seeking a different way to approach the new year.
- Wanting to look at your life as a whole and create greater fulfilment and richness in it.
- Has an idea for a specific project you want to create (and maybe you keep putting it on the back burner).
- Planning something big like a wedding, new business idea or retirement.

This special workshop retreat is for a maximum of 6 people, book early to be sure you're one of them. How about booking a place with your partner and creating a shared vision for your future.

During the workshop you'll
- Plug into the power of your dreams.
- Get in contact with your wisest inner self and use that inner knowing to create your vision from.
- Be coached to explore that vision so it becomes richer and more vibrant.
- Create your own vision board using a collage of images, words and colour.
- Talk about the significance of the elements of your vision so you get to hear yourself claim it out loud.
- Plan how you're going to use your board to keep focussed on what's important to you.
- Spend a day in a warm, cosy home, eat well, share laughter and have some playful fun cutting out!

" My partner and I did this course with Tilla - this weekend we have a romantic retreat by the sea to complete our shared vision board!"   Helen Collier, Money Coach HarmoneyLife

All you need is comfy clothes, a desire to create your own life and an open mind. The desire to have that fun will also come in useful! This is Blue Peter for adults!

I'll provide all the materials, and if you want to bring along old magazines to share around that'll be great.]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[7008]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[5 Wensley Grove]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[4308]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[Tilla Brook]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[23 Mar 2014 9:30am - 4:30pm]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/9945.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/9945.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[9784]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Introduction To Millinery: Make A Cocktail Hat ]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[A fun, one-day workshop with milliner Claire Spooner, who will show you some basic techniques as you hand-block and hand-sew your own fabulous little vintage-style cocktail hat.

Andy invites audiences to help build a collection of their favourite animal idioms and expressions using social media and an installation.
 
To accompany Crow_Sourcing, a series of 60-90 minute creative, fun workshops will feature across three days. Children aged between 6 and 11 years old are invited to explore art, technology and nature. 
 
In groups, the children will be able to create absurd and unusual creatures using craft materials and stencils, record animal sound bites, and explore language to describe their creatures, making funny and nonsensical names for them. They can then take their creations home or display at the venue.
 
Crow_Sourcing is part of Digital Zoo - Life from the world wild web, London's Furtherfield and CultureCode's groundbreaking national touring exhibition at Trinity Leeds shopping centre.
 
Digital Zoo is supported by Arts Council England through the Strategic Touring programme.

Open to adult mental health service users.  A creative project with professional artists Jill Johnson and Beverley Haines.

A Bird's Eye View is inspired by a collection of aerial photos of Leeds & Britain, taken by daring young men in their flying machines.  Looking at these photos and seeing the changing scenery over the years will inspire us to explore this landscape through creativity.  Starting with simple printing and layering techniques we'll let our imaginations take flight and go wherever the creative flow takes us!]]></description><place_id><![CDATA[3209]]></place_id><place_title><![CDATA[Artlink West Yorkshire]]></place_title><organiser_id><![CDATA[6383]]></organiser_id><organiser_title><![CDATA[Artlink West Yorkshire]]></organiser_title><event_date><![CDATA[30 Apr 2014 - 16 Jul 2014]]></event_date><image_thumbnail><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10518.jpg]]></image_thumbnail><image_original><![CDATA[http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10518.jpg]]></image_original></item><item><event_id><![CDATA[10408]]></event_id><event_title><![CDATA[Wire Bird Workshop With Chris Moss]]></event_title><description><![CDATA[Having admired the work of Yorkshire wire sculptor Chris Moss at a number of exhibitions over the years, we are thrilled to welcome her to Skelton Grange Environment Centre to lead a workshop for us!

Before you set out on a journey it helps to know where you're going. If not, you're going to end up SOMEWHERE . . . just not where you want to be.

What if your elusive dreams took shape before your eyes? What would you discover? What could you then bring into your life for real?

Vision boards are a fabulous technique for focussing our energy and commitment on what's important. Then we get to have more of it in our lives. Pictures, words, photos, lines from poems, colour - they all help to create a powerful reminder of what you want in your future.

Making them in a workshop is fun, playful, stress free and collaborative. You get to share ideas and tell other people about yours. That's the added extra of doing this with others - you get to say it out loud as well.

"I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I lived just the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well." Diane Ackerman

This workshop will suit anyone who is
- Seeking a different way to approach the new year.
- Wanting to look at your life as a whole and create greater fulfilment and richness in it.
- Has an idea for a specific project you want to create (and maybe you keep putting it on the back burner).
- Planning something big like a wedding, new business idea or retirement.

This special workshop retreat is for a maximum of 6 people, book early to be sure you're one of them. How about booking a place with your partner and creating a shared vision for your future.

During the workshop you'll
- Plug into the power of your dreams.
- Get in contact with your wisest inner self and use that inner knowing to create your vision from.
- Be coached to explore that vision so it becomes richer and more vibrant.
- Create your own vision board using a collage of images, words and colour.
- Talk about the significance of the elements of your vision so you get to hear yourself claim it out loud.
- Plan how you're going to use your board to keep focussed on what's important to you.
- Spend a day in a warm, cosy home, eat well, share laughter and have some playful fun cutting out!

" My partner and I did this course with Tilla - this weekend we have a romantic retreat by the sea to complete our shared vision board!"   Helen Collier, Money Coach HarmoneyLife

All you need is comfy clothes, a desire to create your own life and an open mind. The desire to have that fun will also come in useful! This is Blue Peter for adults!

I'll provide all the materials, and if you want to bring along old magazines to share around that'll be great.

This course will take advantage of our location, integrating the beautiful surrounding countryside of Yorkshire with the imagery used in SRT and using this as a spring board for creative work. The course will include two trips out into Yorkshire's breath-taking countryside to visit Brimham Rocks and Timble which will feed into our creative explorations in the studio.

Skinner Releasing Technique (SRT) is a pioneering approach to dance, movement and creative process that has evolved from the simple principle that when we are releasing physical tension, we can move with greater freedom, power and articulation. Artists, actors, dancers, musicians, poets and curious explorers of all kinds welcome! All levels of experience welcome.

"A fantastic experience. Excellent teachers... very accessible, inspiring introduction to the technique. The best course I have ever experienced by far!!! I will take all I have learnt back into my practice and continue experiencing the work." Participant Feedback - Moving Landscapes'13

"Love the invitation for non-dancers - I never felt intimidated or out danced. Have seen a definite change in my body and felt so much more." Participant Feedback - Moving Landscapes '13.
