The architect, George Corson, was heavily influenced by his assistant James Robertson Watson who had undertaken a tour of Europe\u2019s churches and theatres. <br />\n\n<br />\n\nMany of the design inspirations came from these continental influences, in particular the gothic, ecclesiastical spires. The exterior is in a mixture of Romanesque and Scottish baronial styles, while the interior has such gothic motifs as fan-vaulting and clustered columns.<br />\n\n<br />\n\nOnly those sitting in the best seats were allowed to use the theatre's main entrance. All other patrons were ushered through side entrances in order for the class-conscious Victorians to remain separated from people below their ranks. However there was a \u2018transfer staircase\u2019 which enabled any member of the audience to better his or her position by paying more. Only the Orchestra Stalls had conventional seating.<br />\n\n<br />\n\nThe Dress Circle and Boxes were furnished with free standing chairs, and all other parts of the house had benches. They ranged from upholstered, in the Upper Circle, to plain wooden and back-less in the Gallery which cost a shilling admission. \u2018Packers\u2019 were employed to maximise the number of people sitting on these wooden benches making the experience all the more cramped\u2026and hot!<br />\n\n<br />\n\nThe Grand Theatre celebrated the 125th anniversary of its opening in 2003. It is widely regarded as a major milestone in Victorian theatre building. The scene dock has one of the most complete Victorian scenic paint shops left in Great Britain. This is extremely rare and still in use. <br />\n\n<br />\n\nThe first performance at the theatre was Much Ado About Nothing on 18 November 1878 and stars that have trodden the boards over the years have included Sarah Bernhardt, Ellen Terry, Julie Andrews, Felicity Kendal, Morecambe and Wise and Laurence Olivier.<br />\n\n<br />\n\nSeating 1550 at full capacity, the auditorium provides a home for performances of all types.<br />\n\n<br />\n\nAn enormous range of notable dance, drama, comedy and music productions have been seen at the Grand. <br />", "title": "Leeds Grand Theatre", "image": "", "long": null, "lat": null, "thumbnail": ""}}, {"pk": 395, "model": "places.place", "fields": {"description": "Since opening in March 1990, West Yorkshire Playhouse has established a reputation both nationally and internationally as one of Britain's most exciting producing theatres, winning awards for everything from its productions to its customer service.<br />\n\n<br />\n\nThe West Yorkshire Playhouse complex comprises: The Quarry Theatre (750 seats), The Courtyard Theatre (350 seats) a CAMRA award-winning bar, a restaurant, The Newlyn Gallery, two function rooms (The Congreve Room and The Priestley Room), three rehearsal spaces, a recording studio, extensive technical workshops, dressing rooms, a Costume Hire department and offices for production, administrative and artistic teams. <br />\n\n<br />\n\nThe Playhouse provides both a thriving focal point for the communities of West Yorkshire, and theatre of the highest standard for audiences throughout the region and beyond.

Come down and see what really makes them tick.\n\nWilliam Potts began making clocks in Pudsey in 1833 before moving to central Leeds in 1862. With a growing fame for the quality and reliability of their clocks the company received a Royal Warrant from Queen Victoria in 1897. Over five generations the Potts family produced some 1,600 public clocks for towns all over Britain and across the world.\n\nThis exhibition brings together examples spanning the history of the company and features a varied collection of turret clocks, wall clocks, drum clocks and unusual clock-based items. There are prominent royal clocks and an example of the company's famous railway clock from Argentina.

The exhibition will run for nine months and will consist of two displays; the first will examine Rembrandt's portraits and figure studies and the second, will showcase a selection of Rembrandt's biblical prints.\n\nRembrandt's career as a printmaker ran parallel with his painting, but he rarely treated the same subject in both medium and only on a few occasions did he reproduce his paintings in print.  Indeed for Rembrandt, print was a distinct art form which he pursued as actively as he did his painting; quickly learning the technical skills involved in etching Rembrandt virtually recreated this technique.  His impact and contribution to printmaking is unprecedented and is so significant that it is still reflected in etchings produced today.\n\nPortraits and People brings together Rembrandt's prints of people the first half to this exhibition will focus on his early experimental prints in which Rembrandt developed both his technique and his interest in showing emotion and thought through detailed observations of facial expressions. Highlights include a selection of Rembrandt's iconic self-portraits, etchings of his mother and wife Saskia, a group of Rembrandt's prints of beggars, and a selection of his later and more ambitious prints including 'Faust'.\n\nImage: Cropped self-portrait in cap and scarf with the face dark: bust, signed and dated Rembrandt f. 1633, Haarlem.

The exhibition, curated by art historian Ben Thomas, tours to Leeds from The University of Kent's Studio 3 Gallery.\n\nThe exhibition will review the art and life of Alfred Drury RA (1856-1944), addressing the formative influences on his sculptural practice and his role in the New Sculpture movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Included within the exhibition will be some of Drury's most important, smaller-scale, sculptural works, including his most characteristic masterpieces Griselda, The Age of Innocence and Lilith.\n\nDrury was arguably one of the central figures in the New Sculpture movement because he combined in his art the realism of the great French sculptor Aime-Jules Dalou (1838-1902), with whom he had a long professional relationship, and the Michelangelo-esque vision of Alfred Stevens (1818-75), whose art he revered and whose drawings he collected.\n\nAlongside sculptural works by Alfred Drury, the exhibition will display paintings and medals by the artist, and also documents and photographs from the period. The exhibition will also include works by Aime Jules Dalou, Auguste Rodin, Lord Leighton, and Alfred Stevens.\n\nAlfred Drury and the New Sculpture will be on display at The Stanley & Audrey Burton Gallery from Wednesady 15th January to Sunday 13th April 2014. The gallery is open to the public, Monday - Friday, 10am - 5pm. Admission FREE.\n\nThis exhibition has been made possible with the kind support of grants from the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, the Henry Moore Foundation and the Leeds Art Fund.\n\nThe exhibition will be accompanied by a full programme of related events, including the popular Burton Saturdays, free creative activities suitable for all ages.

Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and Calypso with American Jazz and Rhythm and Blues. It is characterised by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the upbeat. In the early 1960s, Ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British Mods.\n\nMusic historians typically divide the history of Ska into three periods: the original Jamaican scene of the 1960s (First Wave); the English 2 Tone Ska revival of the late 1970s (Second Wave); and the third wave of the Ska movement which started in the 1980s (Third Wave) and rose to popularity in the US in the 1990s.\n\nMods, initially a small group of clothes-focused 1950s working class young men insisted on clothes and shoes tailored to their style, which emerged during the Jazz boom. Early mods watched French and Italian art films and read Italian magazines to look for style ideas. By the summer of 1966, the mod scene was in sharp decline but a Mod revival started in the late 1970s in the United Kingdom. Thousands of Mod revivalists attended scooter rallies in locations such as Scarborough and the Isle of Wight. This revival was partly inspired by the 1979 film Quadrophenia and by Mod-influenced bands such as The Jam, who drew on the energy of New Wave music.\n\nThe British Mod revival was followed by a revival in North America in the early 1980s, particularly in Southern California, led by bands such as The Untouchables. The mod scene in Los Angeles and Orange County was partly influenced by the 2 Tone Ska revival in England, and was unique in its racial diversity, with black, white, Hispanic and Asian participants. The 1990s Britpop scene featured noticeable Mod influences on bands such as Oasis, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene and The Verve.\n\nFrom the Jam, The Beat, The Selecter & Bad Manners are all UK Ska & Mod bands who have seen decades in the music industry racking up many top 10 hits!\n\nSo join us and let's make history!", "end_date": "2014-08-02T16:00:00Z", "title": "Leeds Ska And Mod Festival", "image": "http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/9675.jpg", "place": 295, "image_thumb": "http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/9675.jpg", "start_date": "2014-08-02T16:00:00Z"}}, {"pk": 9676, "model": "events.event", "fields": {"description": "Pop folk star comes to Leeds as part of a UK tour by\nGrammy-nominated, multi-platinum selling, Madison Square Garden conquering singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran.\n\nEd Sheeran has enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame in the music industry.

Inspired by the Romantics' celebration of imagination, each image in the series presents a solitary figure in a landscape, dressed in elements from surroundings that indicate neither time nor place.\n\nThe natural world acts as both content and context in this work, with the characters literally inhabiting the landscape. The production of each image further involves a certain collision of temporality: the fleeting instant of the photographic moment, the more 'mythic' time created within the image and the participants' mental transition as they become one with their wearable sculpture and the surrounding natural landscape.\n\nEyes as Big as Plates is produced in collaboration with retired farmers, fishermen, zoologists, plumbers, opera singers, housewives, artists, academics and ninety-year old parachutists.

After completing his A level examinations at Fulneck School, Toby was awarded the tenor Choral Scholarship at Gloucester Cathedral, for the academic year 2013/14. In October 2014, Toby took up a tenor choral scholarship in the choir of King's College, Cambridge.\n\nToby's musical talent was spotted early, at Bramhope Primary School, and he received piano lessons from the late Michael Sykes of Pool-in-Wharfedale. After a short period at Abbey Grange Church of England High School, Toby was awarded a music scholarship to Fulneck School.\n\nToby, in his first year at King's reading music, is one of fifteen choral scholars who comprise the back row of the famous King's College Choir, formed in 1516. Following a long tradition, the scholars form a touring group now known as The King's Men, performing regularly around Britain, and recently as far afield as North America, Australia and Hong Kong.\n\nToby said:\nIt will be a huge pleasure to return to Leeds Minster, the scene of my early musical education. It was a concert by The King's Men at the minster which inspired me to apply to King's in the first place, so I hope we can help inspire the next generation of the Minster's young musicians, while delivering an entertaining program of music from 500 years ago to the present day.\n\nDr Simon Lindley, Master of the Music at Leeds Minster said:\nWe have welcomed the King's choral scholars to Leeds on a number of occasions in the recent past and the students have been of great assistance in raising the profile of choral music here at the Minster. It's obviously particularly special having Toby return this year as a current King's alumnus. Minster Parishioners, along with staff, parents and students at Toby's schools have expressed considerable interest in attending, as have members and friends of Minster-based St Peter's Singers in which Toby sang for a number of years as a teenager, graduating eventually to the solo ranks.\nThe King's Men is the close harmony group formed from the Choral Scholars of the Choir of King's College, Cambridge. As Choral Scholars they follow the daily routine of Chapel services throughout term, as well as undertaking a busy concert and recording schedule in the vacations.\n\nThe Choir is, of course, most famous for the broadcast of the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols on radio each Christmas, and its companion programme, Carols from King's, on BBC television.\n\nThe King's Men, however, functions separately from the main Choir, and is run entirely by the members of the group itself.

They have been rendered in different forms - expressed in textiles, written in stories, floated down the river or rendered as conventional cartographic representations, albeit with a twist.\n\nIn November and December, we ran two day-long workshops with composer James Redwood. These were open to anyone in the city who wanted to come along and join in. We spent the first day getting to know each other and sharing ideas, thoughts, feelings and impressions of the city, before settling down to write some lyrics that we felt summed up our experiences of living in Leeds. The material we created was quite diverse - quirky, poetic and sometimes slightly sinister. By the end of the first day, we felt we had the basis for three different songs.\n\nThe following week, we worked with James to set the songs to music. James led us in a series of warm-ups, which got us on our feet and singing together and then helped us to find our way into the songs, deciding on a tone and mood for each one, pulling out melodies and rhythms from the group and shaping the resultant material. He then took the pieces away with him to polish up and score.\n\nFrom 24th February onwards, we'll be working with vocal animateur Caroline Challis to bring these songs to life, with a view to singing them at the opening of the project exhibition in Leeds Central Library on 3rd May.\n\nRehearsals will be at the Central Library on Monday evenings (6.15pm - 7.45pm) from 24th February.", "end_date": "2014-04-28T00:00:00Z", "title": "365 Leeds Stories Choir", "image": "http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10020.jpg", "place": 476, "image_thumb": "http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10020.jpg", "start_date": "2014-02-24T00:00:00Z"}}, {"pk": 10023, "model": "events.event", "fields": {"description": "MAIN WRISTBANDED EVENT\n\nLive At Leeds is back this first bank holiday in May!

It had all the appearance of a new instrument but the label inside gave the date 1915 and the name Richard S Howard. Research revealed that the violin had been made - but never finished - by a luthier and some-time music hall performer from Leeds called Richard Spencer Howard.  He had been conscripted in 1915 at the age of 35 and two years later was killed during the battle of Messines Ridge.  The unfinished violin was given to his daughter Rose as a memory of her father.  On her death the parts were bought at auction and the violin was finally finished by luthier Roger Claridge in 2007.  The fiddle was then placed in the window of an Oxford music shop where it was spotted by Sam.\n\nThis multi-media performance, telling the incredible story of the fiddle, marks the 100th anniversary of the start of World War I.

The converted founding member Mark Perro's bedroom in Bushwick into a practice space and rehearsed there nearly every day for three months, cutting more than 40 demos. By the end of that winter, the Men had pared that crop of songs down to 13.

They booked two days at Brooklyn's Strange Weather studios, clocked in, and tracked all 13 songs entirely live, even including a horn section.\n\nEight songs from those sessions made the final cut for The Men's new LP, Tomorrow's Hits. This is their first album recorded in a high-end studio and, appropriately, the result is their most high fidelity album to date. That being said, it is still an incredibly straightforward record.

Why can't we just go out and sing them?\" complains Neil Innes, aka Ron Nasty of The Rutles. \"Maybe we could call it \"Rutalot\", suggests John Halsey, aka Barry Wom, the \"noisy one\" of the so-called \"Pre-Fab Four\". BRAND ON THE RUN! It all began 35 years ago when Eric Idle of Monty Python persuaded Neil Innes, of the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band, to join him in a comedy series for BBC 2 called Rutland Weekend Television - all about a spoof TV station, the smallest in Britain, churning out really cheap programmes on a shoestring.\n\nLow budget? More like No Budget!\n\nInnes suggested to Idle that they could do a send-up of A Hard Day's Night, the Beatles first movie. \"It's in Black and White, it's speeded up, and we could wear wigs and tight trousers and run around a field somewhere...\" \"Great!\" Exclaimed Idle. \"I've got a sketch about a man making a documentary who's so boring, the camera runs away from him...\"\n\nAnd so the name \"Rutles\" was born. But no one could have expected what happened next. A year later, such was the enormous pressure on the Beatles to get back together again, the one-off clip was shown in the USA - on NBC's flagship satire programme: \"Saturday Night Live\". It was a sensation. Thousands of people wrote in. Mailbags were bulging. So were the trousers! Everyone got the joke. Lorne Michaels, the producer, believed the whole Beatles story could now be told - as \"The Rutles\". NBC agreed and gave him the money. Eric Idle quickly came up with the title: \"All You Need Is Cash - the story of the Pre-Fab Four\". Bill Murray, John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd got involved - so did George Harrison, who brought in Mick Jagger and Paul Simon.\n\n\"Last time was just the last time. This time it really is the last time.\" Innes recalls: \"I can clearly remember it all. I was sitting to one side, on a window sill in an executive office, high up in the Rockefeller Centre in New York, listening to all this when suddenly everyone started looking at me. Lorne asked if I could write 20 more Rutle songs by next Thursday lunchtime. I said I would try!\" A second album, \"Archaeology\", with Mickey Simmonds (Keyboards) and \"Rutle\" Ricky Fataar (Stig O Hara) on drums, was released in 1996 - to even greater acclaim. Planned to coincide with the Beatles \"Anthology\" - by public demand - new songs like \"Questionnaire\" and \"Don't Know Why\" were more thoughtful and less of a parody - or as George Harrison sweetly put it - \"all part of the soup\". About 10 years ago, Neil, John and Mickey teamed up with Mark Griffiths on Bass and Ken Thornton on lead guitar, (Ken can almost replace the irreplaceable Ollie Halsall!) and played the Rutle songs live, on stage, in front of teabag throwing devotees, in village halls and at weddings, oh yes, and Glastonbury.\n\n\"It's not a career move,\" explains Innes, \"but over the years we have become a \"Brand\" - and that makes some people very proprietorial.\"\n\"Pro what?\" demands the man who was Barry Wom.\n\"Pro Prietor. You know - Legal Owner?\" says Nasty the adjective.\n\"Oh. I'll keep quiet then.\"\n\"No, no - you can still hit the drums...\"\n\n\n\"Making Rutle music is supposed to be fun, and it IS fun - but someone usually goes and spoils it all by saying something stupid like you can't do this or you can't say that and by laying down the law.\"\nInnes continues with his beef, \"with any luck by the time they get round to suing us we'll have disbanded again!\"\n\"Why don't we just call it \"Rutalot?\" mutters the Noisy One...", "end_date": "2014-05-16T19:30:00Z", "title": "The Rutles", "image": "http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/images/events/10376.jpg", "place": 1043, "image_thumb": "http://www.leedsinspired.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/190x190/public/images/events/10376.jpg", "start_date": "2014-05-16T19:30:00Z"}}, {"pk": 10377, "model": "events.event", "fields": {"description": "This year Judie is touring the UK playing tracks from her new album, \"Woman Overboard\" as well as performing many of her wonderful classic's.

Since 1996, he has produced a range of audio works for Kranky, Alien8, Mille Plateaux, Room40, Force Inc, Staalplaat, and Fat Cat. His works have been described as \"structured ambient\", \"tectonic color plates\" and \"cathedral electronic music\". More to the point, he has focused on exploring the intersection of noise, dissonance and melody, fostering an approach to songcraft which is both physical and emotive. The New York Times has described his work as \"foreboding, abstract pieces in which static and sub-bass rumbles open up around slow moving notes and chords, like fissures in the earth waiting to swallow them whole\". His Harmony in Ultraviolet received critical acclaim, including being recognized by Pitchfork as a top recording of 2006. Radio Amor was also recognized as a key recording of 2003 by Wire magazine. His work has also included commissions for contemporary dance, sound-art installations, as well as various writings. He currently resides in Montreal.His early career was characterised by an interest in techno, expressed under the Jetone moniker.\n\nDisenchanted with this direction, Hecker began exploring more abstract notions of sound and collages, describing this process as 'very brutal, bloody, bone-crushing experiences'.[6] His current method of working involves the use of pipe organ sounds which are digitally processed and distorted. For the album Ravedeath, 1972, Hecker travelled to Iceland where together with Ben Frost, he recorded parts in a church. Live performances contain improvisations by processing organ sounds that are manipulated, with great fluctuations in volume.\n\nHecker collaborated on a project with Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never) who 'had a couple days blocked out in [a] Brooklyn [studio], and Tim came down. There was a day of setup, and then we just rolled tape'. This became Instrumental Tourist album where the two musicians improvised and experimented with different styles.\nIn addition to touring with Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Sigur R&#243;s and recording with the likes of Fly Pan Am, Hecker has also collaborated with Christof Migone, Martin T&#233;treault and Aidan Baker. He has also contributed remixes to other artists, including Isis.\n\nVirgins Reviews - http://www.residentadvisor.net/review-view.aspx?id=13788\nhttp://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18559-tim-hecker-virgins/\nhttp://www.sunblind.net/\n\nKaren Gwyer (Opal Tapes)\nRecording while living in London and pregnant with her son, Iowa-born producer Karen Gwyer assembled a deeply intricate collage for this mesmeric full-length debut.

As his own son is reported missing, the colonel is bitter and critical towards the young Owen who appears to have found a safe niche as Catering Secretary. But as the play develops, the men grow to a deeper understanding. The son survives, while Owen returns to the front, not for motives of patriotism, but to spur himself to write again. (The Clarence Gardens Hotel, now the Clifton, still stands on North Bay.)\n\nThe Edge of the Forest by Peter Spafford has two time scales. A brother and sister now own a house cluttered with war memorabilia - their father's legacy. She wants to sell up, he wants to cling to the past. In fact he has recently become agoraphobic after a mugging incident. The arrival of an estate agent with an eye for the sister pushes things to a climax. The boy is obsessed by Thomas. For long stretches he identifies with him in his mind, imagining his sister and the agent as Edward's wife Helen and their friend the charming and persuasive Robert Frost.
