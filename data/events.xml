<event_title><![CDATA[Alfred Drury And The New Sculpture]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[An exhibition exploring the art and life of Alfred Drury (1856-1944): His influences, his practice and his role in the 'New Sculpture' movement.

The Stanley & Audrey Burton Gallery are excited to be holding an exhibition dedicated to the art of Alfred Drury, one of the leading sculptors of the late Victorian and Edwardian periods, and creator of the much-talked-of bronze nude light standards in City Square, Leeds. The exhibition, curated by art historian Ben Thomas, tours to Leeds from The University of Kent's Studio 3 Gallery.

The exhibition will review the art and life of Alfred Drury RA (1856-1944), addressing the formative influences on his sculptural practice and his role in the New Sculpture movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Included within the exhibition will be some of Drury's most important, smaller-scale, sculptural works, including his most characteristic masterpieces Griselda, The Age of Innocence and Lilith.

Drury was arguably one of the central figures in the New Sculpture movement because he combined in his art the realism of the great French sculptor Aime-Jules Dalou (1838-1902), with whom he had a long professional relationship, and the Michelangelo-esque vision of Alfred Stevens (1818-75), whose art he revered and whose drawings he collected.

Alongside sculptural works by Alfred Drury, the exhibition will display paintings and medals by the artist, and also documents and photographs from the period. The exhibition will also include works by Aime Jules Dalou, Auguste Rodin, Lord Leighton, and Alfred Stevens.

Alfred Drury and the New Sculpture will be on display at The Stanley & Audrey Burton Gallery from Wednesady 15th January to Sunday 13th April 2014. The gallery is open to the public, Monday - Friday, 10am - 5pm. Admission FREE.

This exhibition has been made possible with the kind support of grants from the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, the Henry Moore Foundation and the Leeds Art Fund.

The exhibition will be accompanied by a full programme of related events, including the popular Burton Saturdays, free creative activities suitable for all ages. Full details can be found on our events pages.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Fascinated by the beautiful textures and markings within slate, Daniel Cooper's solo showcase explores this wonderful material with a series of vessels.  His inspiration comes from a visit to Elterwater Slate Quarry in the Lake District where he adopted the working methods, knowledge and local dialect of the quarrymen to produce this collection of works.

<description><![CDATA[Construction for a spatial Structure VI ('KPS6', 1919/73)

Trained engineers, the Stenberg brothers (1899-1982 / 1900-33) were central to the Russian Constructivist movement. Their achievements included designing theatre sets, women's shoes, posters for the films of Sergei Eisenstein and, in 1947, Vladimir designed the May Day decorations for Red Square. This display presents a 1973 reconstruction of the lost 1919 sculptural prototype for a building, known as 'KPS6', or 'Construction for a Spatial Structure VI'. Related archival material shows the brothers' important role in the Moscow avant-garde on the 1920s, tracing this sculpture's continued influence since its original showing at Moscow's Poet's Cafe in January 1922.]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[PAN Berlin Record Label]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Leeds College of Art welcomes an exhibition from PAN, a critically acclaimed platform for experimental sound and art, based between Berlin and New York. This exhibition showcases a range of artwork produced by the label for PAN artists' records.

Founded in 2008 by artist Bill Kouligas, PAN represents a community of artists united by their singular contributions to the electronic vanguard. PAN has released records by some of the world's most acclaimed electronic and experimental artists over its four year lifespan. The beautiful artwork is a critical part of its success, and, for Bill and label partner Kathryn Politis, a crucial part of the business, conceived as a visual project as much as a musical one.

The PAN label boss Bill Kouligas says, "The design of the label has a cohesive aesthetic that the musicians/artists we work with are aware of. There is no fixed process in regards to working with them on the artwork, PAN strive to make something within the concept of their album as far as possible, and we both approve the final artwork. Some artists are more involved than others; some may suggest images they want to use, or drawings of theirs they would like translated into the PVC design. With others we discuss influences that they would like to see incorporated into the design on a more abstract level. In any case, with each release, comes an exchange of ideas. The label was conceived initially as a platform for our artwork and interests. We are trying to not limit ourselves to being a record label in the traditional sense; there have been numerous shows, events, showcases and festivals etc. to date as part of the label, and there are some non-music related projects in the works."

This exhibition is free and open to all members of the public. ]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[This exhibition was organised by respected social-documentary photographer Ian Beesley and the poet and presenter Ian McMillan. The display was brought to Leeds Industrial Museum as part of a continued commitment to draw visitors' attention to industries that remain active in Yorkshire today. The show portrays the mental, social and physical impact mining has on the lives of modern miners and has previously been on display at the National Coal Mining Museum back in 2011.

Taking nearly twenty years to complete, this multi-layered body of work explores the harshness and dangers of coal mining in one of the last working pits in England. The physicality of the work, the relationship between the underground and the surface, the claustrophobia and darkness of the pit are explored in this collaboration between the photographer Ian Beesley, the poet Ian McMillan and the miners of Hayroyd's colliery.

<event_title><![CDATA[Grant Fleming: Hasta La Victoria! ]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[A photographic journey: the struggle for Central America,1988

You could no more describe Grant Fleming simply as "a photographer" any more than you could usefully describe any of the 120 countries he's worked in simply as "a place." If words could do these matters justice, we wouldn't need cameras. Some things resist easy description, as in this case does the person taking the pictures.

'HASTA LA VICTORIA!' is his first major exhibition and showcases images from his first overseas trip with a photographic objective - the upheaval in late 80's Central America via the southern states of the US.

Grant Fleming became politically active in the 80's after fortunately escaping a prison term after a number of collective 'misdemeanours' in his youth. He changed direction and turned to music, tour managing popular punk band Sham 69 at 18, was involved in the Mod Revival in the late 70's, then played bass guitar with the Chords and Lords of The New Church and toured the US until the group split. ]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Make A Felt Scarf]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[In this workshop you will create a stunning, soft and completely unique cobweb felt scarf using the finest merino wool fibres.

The workshop requires no previous knowledge of felt making so is suitable for both the new and more experienced maker.

You will stretch the fibres out, then  using the wet felting method, you will transform the fibres into a delicate and soft scarf.

These scarves are lovely and warm to wear.

All the materials and equipment will be provided on the day but you will need to bring an old towel with you. Due to the nature of these scarves you need a lot of space and we are restricting the numbers to just ten for the session, so book soon to make sure of a place.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[A large paper-mache bra will be walked from Broadcasting Place to Gallery Munro House at 11:00 and set fire to as a symbolic and playful act in recognition of International Women's Day. A giant, joyous beacon that links and acknowledges the concerns, struggles and hopes of women in history with those of today, marking the continued interest in feminism and the fight for equality.

The bra will be built (and burnt) by Leeds Metropolitan University Graphic Arts and Design students with the help of maker Tony Wade from Faceless Company.

The walk will start at Broadcasting Place and will make its way through Leeds City Centre, all the way to Gallery Munro House.

This event is part of 'Saturday Girl', an exhibition by acclaimed photographer Casey Orr.

Details of the exhibition, along with other events linked to this can be at the website (right).

<event_title><![CDATA[Disney On Ice: Worlds Of Fantasy]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[The action-packed ice spectacular that has been dazzling UK arenas for years.

The on-ice excitement begins when an adventurous Mickey Mouse embarks on a journey with Minnie Mouse to uncover each world of fantasy, but the plan goes awry when their cherry red roadster unexpectedly breaks down. Although Donald Duck and Goofy try, it takes the assistance of the coolest cars on the ice to get the pistons firing again. Direct from Radiator Springs, Mater, Lightning McQueen and Sally speed into action, zipping and zooming around the frozen highway in an effort to re-energize the roadster.

The life-sized Cars characters are outfitted with custom animatronics including blinking eyes and hydraulic lifts that bounce to the beat of the music. Mater and McQueen even come complete with moving mouths, enabling their dynamic personalities to shine through each time they speak.

As Mickey and Minnie's "road trip" continues, Production Designer Jeremy Railton's whimsical scenery transforms the arena into an environment that captures the essence of each unique world to follow. Fluorescent coral and clam shell drums embody Ariel's world in The Little Mermaid and audiences enter the colorful fantasy land of fairies for the Tinker Bell segment in Pixie Hollow.

Because fairies are miniature in size, inflatable technology creates a giant tree backdrop. In the finale, larger than life butterflies float onto the ice as oversized inflatable flowers bloom around the ice signifying the arrival of spring.

The second act of Worlds of Fantasy brings together all the fun, humor and warmth of the beloved Disney/Pixar film Toy Story 3. Woody, Jessie, Buzz Lightyear and the rest of the familiar gang hit the ice for the ultimate Toy Story experience. A completely different creative team put together the lighting, costumes and tailor-made choreography for this high energy segment of the production.

Worlds of Fantasy offers the perfect combination of elements for fans of Disney On Ice. More than ever before, there's something for everyone.]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Potts Of Leeds (Clocks Of Character)]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[From the Town Hall to the Corn Exchange, so many of the clocks familiar to us in the townscape of Leeds and beyond were made by Potts of Leeds. To celebrate the work of this great Leeds company Armley Mills is exhibiting the Potts family's private collection of clocks for the public for the very first time. Come down and see what really makes them tick.

William Potts began making clocks in Pudsey in 1833 before moving to central Leeds in 1862. With a growing fame for the quality and reliability of their clocks the company received a Royal Warrant from Queen Victoria in 1897. Over five generations the Potts family produced some 1,600 public clocks for towns all over Britain and across the world.

This exhibition brings together examples spanning the history of the company and features a varied collection of turret clocks, wall clocks, drum clocks and unusual clock-based items. There are prominent royal clocks and an example of the company's famous railway clock from Argentina. There will also be never-before-seen archive documents from the earliest days of the Potts company. Uniquely, all of the clocks on display will be wound daily and will run for the duration of the exhibition. If you've ever wondered what the workings of a cathedral clock look like, or questioned where the tick-tock sound comes from then the Potts of Leeds - Clocks of Character exhibition is the place to get all the answers.

There is no additional charge for visiting this exhibition.

<event_title><![CDATA[Rembrandt: Portraits & People]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Etchings from the Collection of Leeds Art Gallery.

This season's Winter/Spring exhibition at Temple Newsam House offers the rare chance to see a selection of prints made by the greatest printmaker the world has ever seen - Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn (1606 - 1665).  The exhibition will run for nine months and will consist of two displays; the first will examine Rembrandt's portraits and figure studies and the second, will showcase a selection of Rembrandt's biblical prints.

Rembrandt's career as a printmaker ran parallel with his painting, but he rarely treated the same subject in both medium and only on a few occasions did he reproduce his paintings in print.  Indeed for Rembrandt, print was a distinct art form which he pursued as actively as he did his painting; quickly learning the technical skills involved in etching Rembrandt virtually recreated this technique.  His impact and contribution to printmaking is unprecedented and is so significant that it is still reflected in etchings produced today.

Portraits and People brings together Rembrandt's prints of people the first half to this exhibition will focus on his early experimental prints in which Rembrandt developed both his technique and his interest in showing emotion and thought through detailed observations of facial expressions. Highlights include a selection of Rembrandt's iconic self-portraits, etchings of his mother and wife Saskia, a group of Rembrandt's prints of beggars, and a selection of his later and more ambitious prints including 'Faust'.

<event_title><![CDATA[Of Mice & Men]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[John Steinbeck's iconic novella is driven by one of literature's most enduring and unlikely friendships.

George and Lennie are migrant workers, one smart, the other strong, drifting from town to town across the vast dustbowl of California. Together they've cooked up a plan to escape, a dream of freedom - saving their nickels to buy a small farm of their own and live off the fat of the land.

But when they're hired on a ranch close to the Salinas River, their dream slowly and unexpectedly unravels amidst the simmering tensions of the lonely ranchers around them.

This timeless story of loyalty, survival and hope is set to a haunting, melodic live score by avant-Americana musician Heather Christian and is directed by West Yorkshire Playhouse's new Associate Director Mark Rosenblatt and designed byMax Jones.]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Spring Awakening]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Unnerving, entertaining, funny and dark, Wedekind's explosive play about youth caused riots when it burst onto the stage in 1906.  In the intervening 100 years it has lost none of its provocative power. Brought bang up to date by award-winning young playwright Anya Reiss and director Ben Kidd, this new version examines the exuberance, intensity and confusion of teenage life today. Spring Awakening asks important and pressing questions about how young people are shaped for their future by a generation that doesn't understand them.

Breathing fresh life into this classic text Spring Awakening is co-produced with the Nuffield Theatre as well as Headllong, the ground breaking British company, whose remarkable sell-out version of 1984 was recently seen at the Playhouse. Anya Reiss is the winner of both the Evening Standard and the Critics' Circle Awards for Most Promising Playwright.

This production marks the beginning of a three year partnership to champion the work of emerging directors.]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Bruce McLean: Beyond the Pose]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Bruce McLean is a sculptor who makes work that draws on a variety of media from live art, film, photography, painting and sculpture, dispensing with categories of definition as it moves across media, carried by an interdisciplinary, riotous imagination. Significantly McLean is a sculptor who has been professor of painting at The Slade for over 25 years and now, recently retired, has been prolific in producing work that continues to enliven and interrogate the very nature of sculpture.

The exhibition draws upon work made by Bruce McLean over 50 years but through the prism of new and recent work. Introducing his work to audiences not familiar with his distinctive, irreverent voice and providing new perspectives by creating surprising junctures between earlier and new work, it shows McLean to be an artist who, frequently joining forces with others, consistently breaks rules, and permits audiences to experience work that disrupts disciplines and breaches borders.

Paintings present sculpture and are sculptural, photography is performance, live works and ceramics act as sculptures. This exhibition aims to get to the heart of this mischievous sense of play and iconoclasm.

The exhibition is a partnership with Firstsite, Colchester.

<event_title><![CDATA[Nocturne: Journeys Into The Night-time With Atkinson Grimshaw And George Shaw]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA['For countless millennia humankind has lived in step with the cycles of the moon; planting crops, wooing lovers and gathering harvests according to celestial clockwork. It is scarcely more than a century since this connection was decisively broken, since we turned our back on the sky and our faces towards the brilliantly lit interiors..' James Attlee: 'Nocturne' 2011

We have traditionally feared the night and wanted to lighten the darkness, but for artists it has also been a zone of uncertainty to capture in painted form.  This display sets Leeds artist Atkinson Grimshaw's much loved 19th century 'moonlights' alongside Turner-prize nominee George Shaw's atmospheric paintings of the housing estate where he grew up (from the Arts Council Collection).

Also included are paintings by Jack Yeats, George Sauter and Walter Greaves.

This display celebrates the continuing partnership between Leeds Museums & Galleries and the Arts Council Collection, supported by Christies.

<event_title><![CDATA[Frozen]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's The Snow Queen, this delightful children's animation goes one better by having not one but two beleaguered princesses.

The sweet and intrepid Anna (Bell, WHEN IN ROME) is desperately searching for her missing sister Elsa (Menzel, BEOWULF), whose icy powers have thrown the kingdom of Arendelle into eternal winter. But as Anna's quest gradually reveals, Elsa is not really so villainous, and along the way Anna solicits the help of a comic snowman called Olaf (Josh Gad, THE INTERNSHIP), rugged mountain man Kristoff (Jonathon Groff, Glee), and a reindeer called Sven.

Teaming up with co-writer Jennifer Lee, legendary animator and director Chris Buck (THE LITTLE MERMAID, POCAHONTAS) conceived FROZEN as a 3D epic, and added to its considerable impact by filming in CinemaScope.

Director: Chris Buck, Jennifer Lee
Country: US, 2013
Duration: 108mins
Certification: PG
Featuring the voices of: Kristen Bell, Josh Gad, Idina Menzel

<event_title><![CDATA[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Gered Mankowitz is a British photographer of the rock music scene during the past 40 years. His exhibition - The Jimi Hendrix Experience - will be presented here at White Cloth Gallery during March and April.

Gered's photos were taken at a pivotal point in Jimi Hendrix's short career. These iconic portraits capture the mystery and otherworldliness defining his public image, just as Gered's 1965-67 portraits of the Rolling Stones defined them as the antithesis of the Beatles. This Hendrix exhibition gives a clear insight into the real Jimi relaxing upbeat, smiling and happy.

"Jimi was so positive and excited about what was happening to him. He was easy to work with and a pleasure to be around. Jimi was very shy and retiring, humble and modest. Not starry or assertive and that pretty well remained the case during the time that I knew him. There was a complete contrast between the man on stage and the man in person." Gered Mankowitz]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Hugo Glendinning & John Avery

unstill by photographer and filmmaker Hugo Glendinning is a big-screen projected photo-work with newly commissioned music by John Avery (long-time collaborator with Forced Entertainment and Wendy Houstoun).

Glendinning's work draws on 30 years of photographing dance and performance, also including work from across his archive. John Avery's music both leads and follows the imagery in a series of long leaning notes that float, and are held, at once in motion and waiting to move.

This piece is part of Juncture 2014, Yorkshire Dance's festival of contemporary movement, theatre and film work, taking place at various venues throughout Leeds from 4-15 March. Juncture is curated by Wendy Houstoun, award-winning maker of art.

<description><![CDATA[Have you ever fancied yourself as an orchestra conductor? You could fulfil your ambitions for one day this week, all in aid of a good cause.

The Leeds University Union Music Society (LUUMS) will be performing a one off show with a twist!

From 1pm until 3pm this Saturday members of the public will have the opportunity to step up to the podium and conduct the 30-strong orchestra!

Students will play a variety of well-known classical pieces including Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik and The Blue Danube from Strauss, all under the direction of budding orchestra conductors selected from The Light's customers.

The event has been organised by LUUMS to raise awareness of their upcoming charity concert at Leeds Town Hall on Sunday 16 March (from 3pm), in support of Lost Chord.

The Maltby-based organisation produces more than 1,300 interactive musical sessions a year in 130 homes, designed to stimulate responses from people with dementia through the media of music, song and dance.  A staggering &pound;4,637.68 was raised by LUUMS for the cause in 2013.]]></description>

'In the world of wildlife sound recording, Chris Watson is the daddy' The Guardian


Hy Brasil is a mysterious, enchanted island, hidden in fog somewhere off the coast of Ireland. It reveals itself to human eye and ear just one day every seven years. This specially commissioned work by sound artist Chris Watson (BBC TV's award-winning Frozen Planet), brings that day on Hy Brasil to life in an immersive sound installation.

Hy Brasil is composed of compelling wildlife sounds from around the world, drawing visitors deep into the haunting song of seals and the awe-inspiring shrieks of thousands of Manx shearwaters. With glorious ambi-sonic sound and beautiful lighting, lose yourself in the strange and magical world of Hy Brasil.

<event_title><![CDATA[Eyes As Big As Plates]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[This performance is the culmination of a week's work, during which the Finnish-Norwegian artist duo Riitta Ikonen and Karoline Hjorth have been working with older people from Leeds and West Yorkshire.

Starting out as a play on characters from Nordic folklore in 2011, Eyes as Big as Plates has evolved into a continual search for modern human's belonging to nature. Inspired by the Romantics' celebration of imagination, each image in the series presents a solitary figure in a landscape, dressed in elements from surroundings that indicate neither time nor place.

The natural world acts as both content and context in this work, with the characters literally inhabiting the landscape. The production of each image further involves a certain collision of temporality: the fleeting instant of the photographic moment, the more 'mythic' time created within the image and the participants' mental transition as they become one with their wearable sculpture and the surrounding natural landscape.

Eyes as Big as Plates is produced in collaboration with retired farmers, fishermen, zoologists, plumbers, opera singers, housewives, artists, academics and ninety-year old parachutists. As active participants in our contemporary society, these older people encourage the rediscovery of a demographic group too often labelled as marginalized or even as a stereotypical cliche. It is in this light that the project aims to generate new perspectives on who we are and where we belong.

The series has so far been exhibited at: Pioneer Works, Brooklyn, NYC (2013), TrÃ¸ndelagsutstillingen, Trondheim (2013), Museum of Contemporary Art Kiasma (2012), The Finnish Norwegian Cultural Institute, Oslo (2012), Shibuya, Tokyo (2012) and KINO KINO, Sandnes (2011). A book publication is also underway.

<event_title><![CDATA[The Pirates Of Penzance]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Avast landlubbers!

Gird your loins, lock up your daughters and shiver your timbers, the Pirates of Penzance are in town! The infamous buccaneers will be dropping anchor at the Carriageworks Theatre, in the company of Leeds Gilbert and Sullivan Society.

Four times winners of the Leeds Civic Arts Guild Award for Best Musical, the society is well known in Yorkshire for its fresh, lively approach to the Gilbert and Sullivan Operettas. This year is no different, as we take the well-loved show to a new setting. Late at night in Penzance, a ripple runs through the exhibitions and the Pirates Through The Ages display begins to stir.

Pirates tells the tale of Frederic, an apprentice pirate who has reached his 21st year. As he leaves his pirate band forever, he meets the beautiful Mabel on the beach, out for a picnic with her gaggle of sisters. Having swiftly wooed Mabel, he warns the girls that the pirates are nearby, but too late! They capture the girls and prepare to marry them... until stopped by their father, Major-General Stanley who, knowing the pirates' soft hearts fibs that he is an orphan. The pirates reluctantly release their brides.

Later that evening as the story unfolds Frederic faces a dilemma: should he re-join the pirates and betray the women he loves. Will he chose love, or duty?

Pirates is one of the popular and rollicking of the Gilbert and Sullivan operettas. Gilbert's sparkling wit combines with Sullivan's magical melodies and the occasional pirate or two to make a winning combination that young and old alike will love.
We look forward to welcoming you to Penzance museum. Which side will you be on - pirates or policemen?

<event_title><![CDATA[Her Place]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[For the first time Inkwell Arts has invited artists from around the globe; Australia, New York, the Philippines and the UK.

Her Place includes art work from nine women artists:  Laura Wills (Au) depicts a woman's life journey of spirituality and belonging in her drawings on maps, Mary Pulford (Au) and Ronna Lara- Bes (Ph) delicately illustrate some of their native wildlife through printmaking and watercolour. Heidi Russell (USA) conveys the feeling of being both resident and tourist through a series of photographs of New York. Amanda Burton's (UK) work reflects her time in her homeland Malaysia, whilst Bridget Riversmith's (USA) work has a more internal response with figurative works, and Maureen Prichard's (AU) beautifully hand coloured photographs connect her with her artist Grandmother.  Julia Bickerstaff (UK) combines art and engineering in her Neon works and film buff Charlotte Brooke (UK) captures the zeitgeist of Hollywood with a series of photo realistic drawings.

The exhibition opening takes place on Saturday 8th March from 6pm - 8pm where you will have the opportunity to buy any of the beautiful artwork on show and meet some of the artists. Complimentary drinks and refreshments will be on offer. The exhibition runs until April 15th.

The special preview launch will be followed by the IWD poetry evening from 8 - 11pm.

<event_title><![CDATA[Songs For Breaking Britain]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[A storytelling show, with punk music.

Hannah Nicklin and Company are collecting stories - stories from people just getting by, people who don't think they're Important, anyone who will stop and talk to us. We got bored of the media selling our stories back to us. So we're mixing up the old idea of the ballad; sharing stories, passing them on; with a modern form of righteous storytelling; punk music. Three chords, rhyming couplets, lots of noise. Songs from the market place, from the street, stories collected from the people you walk past; of romance, graft, bordem, everyday defeat. Songs for Breaking Britain; theatre, with punk music.
This project is being supported by and developed at OvalHouse, Theatre in the Mill, ARC Stockton, and Slung Low's HUB. With support from Arts Council England's Grants for the Arts, and Third Angel. And with additional collaborators Hannah Jane Walker and Alexander Kelly.

Hannah Nicklin and Company is Hannah Nicklin, Keir Cooper, and Sean Arnold.]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Jordi Cortes - In Heaven]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[In Heaven is part of a trilogy which began with Lucky and Happy Hour. In Lucky Jordi Cortes was looking for the people who are no longer here, a journey through life in front of death. In Happy Hour, he took us on a journey towards happiness.

Now, in In Heaven, Jordi is no longer looking for answers: he's reached the epiphany of the metaphorical heaven mentioned in the title, which allows him to go beyond the two previous versions of himself and explore a multitude of possibilities.

Jordi Cortes is a choreographer and performer who has worked with companies around the world, including DV8 Physical Theatre and Nigel Charnock + Company.

<description><![CDATA[NEW Show, NEW Routines, FUNNIER than Ever!

"Newton has ramped up his act and opted for a more robust manifesto. His mischievous performance has moved perceptibly closer to the line - to the obvious delight of the audience. Getting a hypnotised volunteer to phone his mother was a masterpiece of wind-up comedy. He kept us screeching with laughter right to the end. What lifted the proceedings even more was Newton's skill as an entertainer, something that raises him far above all others of his ilk."
Sydney Morning Herald, May 5 2013.

Give Us Our Daily Dance

"Five years ago I became interested in developing a daily practice to support and maintain training and help elevate my performance and choreographic work. So I set myself the task of dancing everyday, when I say dancing I mean it in the truest sense. Unleashing an internal force, re-connecting with the feelings and ideas that encouraged me to dance in the first place.

"The class will consist of guided exercises,  departure points and lots of flamboyant dancing. We will cultivate a playground of possibilities, discover new forms that collide and stretch our limitations."

<event_title><![CDATA[JUNCTURE 2014: All This Can Happen & Touched]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[A flickering dance of intriguing imagery brings to light the possibilities of ordinary movements from the everyday which appear, evolve and freeze before your eyes. Made entirely from archive photographs and footage from the earliest days of moving image, ALL THIS CAN HAPPEN follows the footsteps of the protagonist from the short story 'The Walk' by writer Robert Walser. Juxtapositions, different speeds and split frame techniques convey the walker's state of mind as he encounters a world of hilarity, despair and ceaseless variety.

Also screening will be the short film TOUCHED choreographed by Wendy Houstoun and directed by David Hinton. This screening is part of Yorkshire Dance's Juncture 2014, a festival of contemporary movement, theatre and film work.

<event_title><![CDATA[Robert M Hayden Workshop]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Robert M. Hayden's Sifting focuses on the body as a 'total instrument', capable of what can be called the 'total act', working on physical actions, movement as theatrical act, and the voice.

A series of physical exercises will establish a strong, vital body-breath connection, unlocking the flow of living impulses within the body, allowing our attention, intention and awareness to flow more freely.

Specific 'impossible' tasks will allow our inner 'obstacles' to become more transparent. Dealing with the element of physical risk or danger, these tasks emphasize our apparent limitations and give us the chance to go beyond them.

We will compositionally combine movement, voice and text to develop our own individual 'score' within which to work. We will focus on relationships between precision and organicity, awareness of space and one's ability to react to its constituent elements, improvisation within a structure as well as dramaturgical elaboration.

By harnessing creative energy in a more present, active and alive manner, the act of creating can then develop within a more structured or compositional frame. Participants will be asked to create a score of actions between 3-5 minutes in length with a clear beginning, middle and end. We will be focusing on its logic, actions, intentions, meaning and content.

This workshop is open to both amateur and professional performers, pedagogues and directors.

<event_title><![CDATA[365 Leeds Stories Choir]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Would you like to sing songs about Leeds?

We are looking for people who enjoy singing to take part in a 10 week choir project. No experience is necessary but enthusiasm is essential!

There are many things we take for granted about the place we live in - and what is familiar to one person may be surprising to someone else. 365 Leeds Stories is a way of sharing our experience of the city in a creative and informal way.

Since September 2013, Leeds-based artists Matthew Bellwood and Alison Andrews have been working together with a range of people who live, work or seek residence in Leeds on the creation of series of maps of the city; maps that tell stories and make connections between the people who live there. They have been rendered in different forms - expressed in textiles, written in stories, floated down the river or rendered as conventional cartographic representations, albeit with a twist.

In November and December, we ran two day-long workshops with composer James Redwood. These were open to anyone in the city who wanted to come along and join in. We spent the first day getting to know each other and sharing ideas, thoughts, feelings and impressions of the city, before settling down to write some lyrics that we felt summed up our experiences of living in Leeds. The material we created was quite diverse - quirky, poetic and sometimes slightly sinister. By the end of the first day, we felt we had the basis for three different songs.

The following week, we worked with James to set the songs to music. James led us in a series of warm-ups, which got us on our feet and singing together and then helped us to find our way into the songs, deciding on a tone and mood for each one, pulling out melodies and rhythms from the group and shaping the resultant material. He then took the pieces away with him to polish up and score.

From 24th February onwards, we'll be working with vocal animateur Caroline Challis to bring these songs to life, with a view to singing them at the opening of the project exhibition in Leeds Central Library on 3rd May.

Rehearsals will be at the Central Library on Monday evenings (6.15pm - 7.45pm) from 24th February.]]></description>

Dr Tim Foxon: Pathways to a sustainable energy system

Climate change is a threat to our current way of life. Access to affordable energy services of light, heat, power and mobility has helped to drive economic development, but the fossil fuels that have provided these services need to be
substituted by renewable and low carbon sources to prevent a catastrophe.

This talk will look at alternative pathways to a sustainable energy system in the UK, and examine the challenge of reducing carbon emissions.

<event_title><![CDATA[Wadjda]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Free event, all welcome!

UTravelActive and Leeds STAR Bike Project are pleased to present a screening of the award-winning film Wadjda, to coincide with UTravelActive's Bike Belles campaign and International Women's Day 2014.

Wadjda is a 10-year-old girl living in a suburb of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. Although she lives in a conservative world, Wadjda is fun loving, entrepreneurial and always pushing the boundaries of what she can get away with.

Wadjda sees a beautiful green bicycle for sale that she wants desperately so she can race her friend, Abdullah. But Wadjda's mother won't allow it, fearing repercussions from a society that sees bicycles as dangerous to a girl's virtue. So Wadjda decides to try and raise the money herself. At first, Wadjda's mother is too preoccupied with convincing her husband not to take a second wife to realize what's going on. And soon enough Wadjda's plans are thwarted when she is caught running various schemes at school.

Just as she is losing hope of raising enough money, she hears of a cash prize for a Koran recitation competition at her school. She devotes herself to the memorization and recitation of Koranic verses, and her teachers begin to see Wadjda as a model pious girl. The competition isn't going to be easy, especially for a troublemaker like Wadjda, but she refuses to give in. She is determined to continue fighting for her dreams...

Wadja is the first feature film shot entirely in Saudi Arabia and is the first feature-length film made by a female Saudi director.

Germany/Saudi Arabia/USA/United Arab Emirates 2012
Certificate PG 96m 54s

<event_title><![CDATA[The Missing Picture (L'image manquante)]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Having chronicled the Pol Pot regime in documentaries such as S-21 THE KILLING MACHINE, director Rithy Panh returns to the subject with this deeply felt account of a childhood endured in various Khmer Rouge labour camps. In these camps Panh suffered profound hunger and brutality in conditions that saw the rest of his family perish. Looking back on the horrific events from middle age, he recreates his experiences with miniature clay figures. These totems of defiled childhood innocence fill the gap indicated in the title - the missing photographic record of the horror and oppression behind the government's official ideology.

Director: Rithy Panh
Country: KH/FR, 2013
Duration: 96mins
Certification: 12A
Narrated by: Randal Douc
French with English subtitles

<description><![CDATA[Gwilym Simcock is one of the most gifted pianists and imaginative composers on the British scene.  Able to move effortlessly between jazz and classical music, he can, at times, inhabit both worlds and has been described as stylistically reminiscent of Keith Jarrett, complete with 'harmonic sophistication and subtle dovetailing of musical traditions' as well as being a pianist of 'exceptional', 'brilliant' and 'dazzling' ability.  His music has been widely acclaimed as 'engaging, exciting, often unexpected, melodically enthralling, complex and wonderfully optimistic'.

<event_title><![CDATA[Woolly Bike Trail Workshop]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Cassandra Kilbride is a prolific yarn-stormer. Her crocheted street art makes cheeky visual statements that offer a new reading of the towns and cities we travel through and the monuments and street furniture we pass by. For the Grand Depart, Cassandra is creating ten woolly bikes for a year-long trail connecting ten towns with the many knitters, crocheters and yarn-stormers that have taken part.

Drawing inspiration from iconic Yorkshire themes including the landscape of the Dales, Yorkshire's textile mills, literary heroines and heroes, and the iconic flat cap, each bike gets a woolly makeover using local yarn. Most of the yarn is the produce of Yorkshire sheep, but one special batch comes from a collection of reclaimed saris. The transformed knitted vehicles will go on display in Sheffield this July, before they take up individual positions along the trail route.

Workshops take place between January and June at festivals and venues across the region and are open to anyone with a basic ability of crocheting.  ]]></description>

<description><![CDATA['Unwind and Relax' focuses on relaxation through restorative yet still physically demanding yoga postures.

'Unwind the body', practised to beautiful low lighting and relaxing music, begins with a short relaxation period to clear the mind, before being guided through a series of energising stretches at a steady pace. The class finishes with a deep relaxation to relieve stress and release tension from the body.

This is the perfect mid-week treat, to stretch out and challenge the body; increase strength and flexibility, whilst completely relaxing the mind, ready for the rest of the week ahead. The class is timed so students can, go home and pretty much straight to bed for a wonderful night's sleep if they would like!

<description><![CDATA[Martin Harley is a phenomenally talented guitarist, singer and songwriter he fronts the highly praised UK-based acoustic trio; The Martin Harley Band. Martin's latest album MOJO FIX which was recorded in Texas, comes on the heels of four critically celebrated albums, years of touring and countless festivals that have built Martin a strong and solid fan-base spanning the globe.

Martin is a deeply important and respected voice in the evolution of popular blues and folk oriented guitar and vocals. He is now expanding on his international success with recent time spent in the US recording and touring.

A life long devotee of acoustic guitar music, especially the ageless blues/roots sounds, Martin has travelled the globe absorbing a plethora of diverse influences and honing his craft into the classic song-writing style he possesses today.

Renowned for his prowess as a slide guitarist, he is almost unique in the UK in his playing lap slide. In other areas and styles, however, he has proved himself a master guitarist and a consistently astounding songwriter. Look for Martin's videos "Winter Coat", "Love In the Afternoon", and "Mojo Fix" taken from the album of the same name.]]></description>

Originally conceived as a casual side-project in 2000, Portland, Oregon's Grails have patiently developed into a rather radical study in tension and meditation, inhabiting a netherworld where virtually all earthly and otherwordly sounds are equally explored to reflect the disparate influences of its four members. After releasing their first two albums on the Neurosis imprint Neurot Recordings, Grails followed up with 'Black Tar Prophecies Vol's 1,2 &, 3' on Important Records before ultimately finding their home at Temporary Residence Ltd.

<event_title><![CDATA[Nonclassical Club Night With Gabriel Prokofiev]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Gabriel Prokofiev is a London-based composer, producer, DJ and founder of the NONCLASSICAL record label & club night.

Composing music that both embraces and challenges western classical traditions, Gabriel has emerged at the forefront of a new approach to classical music in the UK at the beginning of the 21st century.

His Concerto for Turntables was performed at the BBC Proms in August 2011 to critical acclaim, conducted by Vladimir Jurowski with world champion DJ Switch as soloist, and broadcast on BBC2 television.

Other recent works include a poly-stylistic 'orchestral remix' of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony commissioned by John Axelrod and the Orchestre National des Pays de la Loire, France, performed sold-out concert halls in Angers and Nantes in June 2011; a 3rd String Quartet premiered by the Ruysdael Kwartet at the Wigmore Hall in 2010; 'import/export/ a percussion suite for Global Junk, toured in UK & USA by Joby Burgess's Powerplant; and a book for Solo Piano recorded by Russian virtuoso GeNIA.

Prokofiev's own distinctive sound is informed by his background as a producer of hip-hop, grime, and electro records, as well as his earlier involvement in electroacoustic music at York and Birmingham universities, which saw him win a Residency prize at the prestigious Bourges International Electroacoustic Music Competition in 1998.]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[The Unfortunate Case Of Patrick Bourke]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[The Famine Irish in Leeds & the unfortunate case of Patrick Bourke. A lecture by Brendan McGowan.

Between 1841 and 1861 the Irish population of the township of Leeds tripled, from 5,027 to 14,905. The bulk of this community lived in the east end of the town in an area
characterised by destitution, poor sanitation, disease and crime.

In 1862, Patrick Bourke, a native of CountyÃÂ Mayo, being ill and destitute applied for relief to LeedsÃÂ UnionÃÂ Workhouse. On the 31st December of that year, despite having spent more than four decades living in England, Bourke was removed as a
pauper, in accordance with PoorÃÂ Law regulations, and sent to Westport UnionÃÂ workhouse in CountyÃÂ Mayo on the west coast of Ireland.

<description><![CDATA[The Republic of Fentonia presents:

THE CADAVERS (hardcore punk from Sheffield)

This is hardcore punk the way it should be...dark, brooding, powerful, usually fast, tuneful, and with proper singing (non of that screamo nonsense or winey metal bollocks).

https://soundcloud.com/cadaverssheffield
https://www.facebook.com/cadaverssheffield


CHAPTER 13 (post-punk band from Brighouse)

Their punk roots are obvious, but they've evolved into something a little different.

http://soundcloud.com/chapter13


RADIO PARTIZAN (old-skool punk/folk)

Stalwarts of the Leeds punk/post-punk scene, a three piece into sharp songs, great guitar riffs and radical politics, including members of The Monkeywrenchers, so its should be no surprise that a bit of folk-punk creeps into their old-skool punk sets. Great tunes, great performers, lovely people!

https://www.facebook.com/pages/Radio-Partizan/341398845676
https://soundcloud.com/radio-partizan


DEAD SEA STRATEGY (hardcore folk-punk)

"We formed mid 2013, rising from the ashes of previous line ups and are now ready to take over the world. We'll never be folk to the folkies and we'll never be punk to the punks and we really couldn't care less, we play what we think sounds good and make friends along the way."

Sounds punk to me!

<description><![CDATA[Taster opportunties - get active and involved in the outdoors!

Want to get involved in practical phyical activity, learn new skills, get fitter, and do something that makes a difference to your local environment?

We'll be learning new skills around the Skelton Grange site including hard and soft landscaping of the new 'megapond' area, plus traditional hedge laying techniques and there will also chances to get involved in the food growing area and fruit orchard at the centre.

On Friday the 21st of February 2014 there will also be a guided cycle ride happening to the centre - to help people find their way to us. Meet by the White Pedestrian Bridge over the river by the Royal Armories at 9:15am ready for a 9:30 departure to follow the canal side Trans Pennine Trail route to Skelton Grange Environment Centre. Its about a 15-20 minute cycle ride, but traffic free almost all the way - so its a great way to get to know the way to Skelton Grange.]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Words On Tap: Open-Mic Showcase]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Presented by Headingley Litfest ...

One of Leeds' most successful monthly literary events will take part in this year's LitFest. Following appearances from national poets such as Michael Symmons Roberts and Helen Mort, not-for-profit Words on Tap will invite emerging local wordsmiths from the city to take part in an open-mic showcase.

The Chemic Tavern is one Leeds's most celebrated public houses, providing the ideal setting for an informal evening of verse and drink. Always a warm response from the audience and decent pint in the glass, this is a perfect opportunity for any poets wanting to try out new material or take their first steps onto the spoken word stage.

The Words on Tap ethos is very simple: to promote the region's poets and support local pubs, while introducing and promoting free poetry events to audiences that both would and would not ordinarily be interested. We may bend our own rules from time to time depending on the opportunities that should come our way, but these are our main aims - free art in an environment that nurtures it!]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Made Up North]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Made Up North is a new showcase of Northern dance artists, featuring works by Autin Dance Theatre (Birmingham), TheMiddletonCorpus (West Yorkshire/London), Charlotte Jarvis (Edinburgh) and James Morgan (Yorkshire/London). There will be a postshow discussion and Q&A with the choreographers to discuss their work and its wider context, so please do stay for that!

Rebecca Namgauds will be performing a new solo for Autin Dance Theatre, 'Chimera'; TheMiddletonCorpus will be performing their latest work, 'It's What You Don't See'; Charlotte Jarvis will be presenting her solo 'Graceful Warrior', recently seen at a showcase curated by Merseyside Dance Initiative, and James Morgan will be treating us to his latest work, 'Ensemble', on a topic close to all our hearts!

Anthony Middleton has worked with the BalletBoyz and Motionhouse and is now developing his choreographic career and seeking ways of creating further professional development opportunities for Yorkshire-based dance artists. His choreography has been receiving increasing critical acclaim over the last few years, with extremely positive feedback for his latest duet, 'It's What You Don't See', premiered last month at The Place, London. Anthony currently divides his time between West Yorkshire and London and seeks to relocate to Yorkshire in the coming months.

Charlotte Jarvis is a trained ballet and contemporary dancer, and having worked with Ballet Nurnberg, she is now based in Edinburgh, working with a diverse range of local dance and theatre companies including Lazzi Experimental Unit and Bare Essentials.

James Morgan, from Bridlington, is a recent graduate from London Contemporary Dance School and is a freelance dance artist and writer, having founded and edited the independent student magazine Garble. He is interested in the antagonism between 'high art' and entertainment, and desires work which is both provocative and accessible.

Made Up North is produced by Chantal Guevara of Cloud Dance Festival, who has been promoting talented choreographers and promising contemporary dance companies since 2007.

After his award winning show Bravo Figaro Mark sets himself the task of committing 100 Acts of Minor Dissent in the space of a year.

<event_title><![CDATA[Narrative Drive: Jacob Ross]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[INSCRIBE Masterclass series.

Three monthly sessions. The series offers a compact survey of Jacob Ross' immensely popular and highly regarded technical creative approach to crafting fiction. His very successful course has been running for more than fifteen years. Many beginning writers developed and fine-tuned their writing skills in his course, to the point where their work has been shortlisted in major competitions, or won prizes.

Narrative Drive is for writers who want to maximise the quality and impact of their work. At the end of the series you will have a better awareness of your own strengths and weakness as a writer and the steps you need to take to address them. We will examine the building blocks of stories and how they work together to produce strong memorable narratives.

The series will expose you to the very best examples of modern fiction from which you can learn and refine your skills. Your knowledge of contemporary themes and styles will be enhanced. This course is for advanced writers already working on their novel-in-progress or their collection of short stories. You will be required to submit work in advance of the course.]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Words On Tap Survival Kit]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Presented by Headingley Litfest.

Local poet and Words on Tap host Matthew Hedley Stoppard will lead a workshop focusing on some essentials to perpetuate your poetry. The afternoon will incorporate the importance of 'voice' using vinyl recordings of poets, technique and figures of speech, with close attention to zeugma, and poetry games. Any profits from this event will be donated to Help for Heroes. Contact: wordsontap@email.com

Following on from the Words on Tap workshops held at All Hallows Church in Hyde Park in spring last year, this session will encourage the beginnings of poems rather than force finished articles by the end of the three hours. The workshop leader also aims to prompt discussion amongst attendees and examine the reader's perceptions of poetry.

Matthew Hedley Stoppard was born in Derbyshire and lives in East Leeds with his wife and children. His debut collection A Family Behind Glass was included in The Guardian's Readers' Books of the Year 2013 and his poems and stories appear in various magazines and anthologies, both in print and online, and green vinyl disc. He is also a competition winner and founder/organiser/host of monthly not-for-profit literary event Words on Tap.]]></description>

Verdi Nabucco: Overture
Puccini Manon Lescaut: Intermezzo
Tchaikovsky Francesca da Rimini
Elgar Enigma Variations

The City of Leeds Youth Orchestra's performances in recent years are one of the great success stories of music making in the region. The orchestra now numbers nearly 100 young musicians and this programme is perfect to show off these wonderful young talents.

The orchestra will be touring to Perugia in July 2014 and the concert's first half is full of Italian inspiration - Verdi's dramatic overture to Nabucco followed by the most beautiful orchestral intermezzo in all Puccini operas and Tchaikovsky's finest tone poem, which was inspired by the tragic tale of Francesca in Dante's Divine Comedy.

Always keen to perform the great English Orchestral works, the orchestra is proud to be performing Elgar's Enigma Variations both in their home city but
also when they represent Leeds in Italy.

<description><![CDATA[Stupid Women is a live directed improvisation. It aims to combine idiocy with skill, anarchy with meaning and costumes with music. A number of guests, of high calibre and low pay, attempt the possible and quite probably fail.

Stupid Women is an endeavour made especially for Juncture as a tribute to the late and great Nigel Charnock whose piece Stupid Men irritated and annoyed most audiences that saw it.

We are hoping to be able to achieve something similar.

Stupid Women will have been created at Yorkshire Dance over four days by Wendy Houstoun with Jo Fong, TC Howard, Sophie Unwin, Vivien Wood and others.

Part of Yorkshire Dance's Juncture; a festival of contemporary movement, theatre and film work curated by Wendy Houstoun.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Trio Literati presents a rich garland selected from the works of Alfred, Lord Tennyson.

Tennyson,still one of our most popular and frequently quoted poets, also holds the record as England's longest serving Poet Laureate (1850 - 1892).

Described by TS Eliot as"the great master of metric as well as melancholia", Tennyson struggled against alcoholism and frequent depression to produce a hugely varied body of work. His genius encompassed the crisp six-line Eagle and the ballad-like Lady of Shalott, the martial energy of The Charge of the Light Brigade, and the rich grandeur of his
longer pieces- The Lotos Eaters, Ulysses, In Memoriam and the Arthurian re-telling The Idylls of the King.

Against the dark background of Tennyson'slife Trio Literati offer a colourful and stylish bouquet - old favourites and surprising findssuch as his verse play The Falcon.

<description><![CDATA[Ticket price includes free popcorn, powdered sugar doughnuts and a beer.

True Romance is a 1993 American romantic crime film directed by Tony Scott and written by Quentin Tarantino and it certainly isn't your run-of-the-mill love story.

A modern day Bonnie and Clyde. Clarence and Alabama meet, fall in love. They then proceed to steal a whole lot of drugs from Alabama's pimp and try to sell it in Hollywood, while the owners of the coke try to reclaim it.

The film stars Christian Slater and Patrica Arquette, and includes stellar performances by Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt (as a total pothead), and James Gandolfini. Even Val Kilmer as "Elvis" makes a cameo.

As ever, the White Cloth Gallery Bar will be open, serving drinks and food to enjoy whilst watching the movie.

What better way to spend a Sunday afternoon. You could do worse my friend, you could do worse.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The person sat next to you offers you their hand. You take it and then notice that everyone else in the room has begun holding hands too. A man starts to speak. He says:
"Hello everybody, my name is..."
Moving through moments of playful interaction, participation and celebration, We Used To Wait explores what it means to be 'live' and present together in an increasingly digital world. We Used To Wait invites its audience to question why falling asleep on a stranger's shoulder, playing a spontaneous game and feeling the wind of someone run past you might be important.
A rectangle of chairs. Audience and performers sat side by side. No set. Just us together. And a gentle invitation to interact...
"Here I am. Here we are. Here we go."

With a line up of fiddle, flute, button box, guitar, bodhran & vocals plus a few other instruments & some sean-nos dancing (space permitting!) expect some great craic at the Courthouse tonight.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Sunday Night Blues Dance Lesson and Social Dance.

Join us for the start of a brand new blues experience in Leeds!

The Squeeze is a monthly blues dance event where you can learn authentic blues and blues fusion dance, and move to some of the most sultry and smoking tunes north of Memphis - music from Nina Simone to Nora Jones, Ray Charles to James Blake.

Low lights glisten, shimmering images of projected dancers glide overhead.  The sound of Delta blues, cool jazz and current soul fills the air as pairs of dancers shimmy, shake and slide across the dancefloor with seemingly effortless abandon.  This is the cutting edge of contemporary blues dance, this is The Squeeze.

Beginners Blues Class 8pm - 9pm
Social Blues Dance 9pm - midnight
No experience necessary or partner required

Cosy venue, delicious food and drinks!

FAQs

What is Blues Dance?
Blues dance is a distinctive style of dancing which developed alongside blues music more than 100 years ago and is still developing today, with a huge revival in many cities all over the world.

I've never danced (anything!) before, can I still join?
Absolutely, the class at 8pm will be aimed at absolute beginners, but there will enough content to satisfy those who have previously danced blues too.

Do I need to buy a ticket?
It's strongly recommended that you buy a ticket beforehand as similar events have sold out, and due to the cosy nature of the venue, once we get to capacity, to ensure our dancers' comfort and safety, we will not be allowing any more participants.  The only way to guarantee your place at the dance is to buy a ticket beforehand.

What do I need to bring?
Just your ticket (otherwise it's &pound;5 on the door, if we still have space).  Wear comfortable clothes and shoes. You're welcome to come along with a partner or group of friends, but many people come on their own, and as long as there's space, we will accommodate you, whatever group size you are.

What kind of music do you play?
We play everything from traditional blues and swing jazz from the 1920s onwards, right up to blues-friendly tunes from the last few years, including a sprinkling of soul, r&b and torch songs.

Why the Squeeze?
Blues dancing is best suited to cosy, informal venues, and as Upstairs at LS6 has a maximum capacity of 60 people, the name just seemed to fit!]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Darius Battiwalla - Halifax Organist]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Dupre -  Symphonie-Passion Le monde dans l'attente du

Brahms - Chorale Prelude and Fugue: O Traurigkeit,

Roger - Ducasse Pastorale

Lemare - Rondo Capriccio (A study in accents)

Bach - Jig Fugue, S577

Bach/Dupre  Sinfonia (Cantata 29) - Wir danken Dir, Gott

At the heart of Darius Battiwalla's programme of vivid and spectacular musical contrasts comes the extended Pastorale by Bourdeaux-born musician (Jean Sauveur - Crucifixion O Herzeleid Jules Aimable) Roger-Ducasse, a composer known invariably only by his double-barrelled surname. Like fellow-countrymen Paul Dukas and Maurice Durufle, Roger-Ducasse was astonishingly self-critical as a creative artist and only a relatively small number of works survive for posterity.
Of these, by far one of the most significant is the Pastorale. This extensive piece, one of the most important in the French romantic repertoire is, strangely, played only infrequently by French players; in them main, it is English and American concert artists keep its flame alive. Roger-Ducasse was the close friend and pupil of Faure, whom he followed as Professor of Composition at the Paris Conservatoire; in 1935 Roger-Ducasse was, in addition, appointed Professor of Orchestration in succession to Paul Dukas. The Pastorale was composed in 1909.

<description><![CDATA[Emily Mayhew will introduce the first comprehensive account of medical care at the Western Front.

Wounded traces the journey made by a casualty from the battlefield to a hospital in Britain. It is a moving story told through the testimony of those who cared for him - stretcher bearers and medical officers, surgeons and chaplains, orderlies and nurses - from the aid post in the trenches to the casualty clearing station and the ambulance train back to Blighty.

We feel the calloused hands of the stretcher-bearers; we see the bloody dressings and bandages; we smell the nauseating gangrene and, at London's stations, the gas clinging to the uniforms of the men arriving home.

There are the unspeakable injuries: the officer with a hole in his torso so big the doctor can see the sky beyond him; a man with no legs holding a hymnbook for a man with no arms.

Together, the experiences in Wounded encapsulate what it was to fight, live and die for four long years at the Western Front.

Wounded is a homage to the courageous and determined
men and women who saved hundreds of thousands of lives.

Their new momentum is driven  by core members John Jones, Alan Prosser , Ian Telfer and Dil Davies, with  the chemistry at the heart of the band as vital as ever, and augmented by the bass playing of Al Scott, their producer, the cello of Adrian Oxaal [formerly of the band James] and the emotional singing of Rowan Godel.

'Jaw-droppingly impressive' The Independent

The inimitable a cappella group Naturally 7 comes to the Howard Assembly Room following their late-night prom performance at the Royal Albert Hall in 2013. Building on the heritage of gospel with a style described as 'vocal play', in this special concert the group returns to its roots with an intimate evening of the great gospel songs they love.

With a style that incorporates scratching, drum kit, harmonica, brass, electric guitars and bass, all produced, naturally, with the human voice, Naturally 7 are a mind-blowing and joyful experience.

<description><![CDATA[Presented in English by guest speakers Loic Artiaga (University of Limoges) and Matthieu Letourneux (Univ. Paris-Ouest Nanterre)

He has re-appeared in films and comics up to the present day.

<description><![CDATA[Meet Leeds-based crime writer Alison Taft as she talks about her latest novel, Shallow Be Thy Grave, published in late 2013.

Alison is the author of the Lily Appleyard series - her first novel, Our Father, Who Art Out There... Somewhere was set in Headingley and followed Lily's search for her birth father, a man she'd never met.

The sequel, Shallow Be Thy Grave, sees Lily having to navigate Paris against the backdrop of the fall of communism, whilst learning to deal with the consequences of her hugely dysfunctional family.

Alison will be talking about creating dramatic pace, sustaining tension and how to commit the perfect murder - and get away with it.

<description><![CDATA[A MICA talk with Jules Wyman

Have you ever 'acted' with confidence to get through a situation? Have you ever worried about coming across as over confident? Or have you recently had your confidence knocked? If so then there are simple and effective ways of growing authentic confidence and feeling calm. In this talk Jules will uncover the myths around confidence and will give you practical tools to apply to your lives so you too can discover the truths in order for you to develop your own self-belief.

Jules Wyman is one of the UK's leading confidence coaches. She has been described as a 'truly inspiring speaker' and was voted Britain's Next Top Female coach in 2009. Jules' amazing journey as a confidence coach began with herself, building her own confidence and in doing so shattered the myth that 'you are born with confidence, and that it is not something you can develop'. Jules now speaks and coaches globally about confidence matters and in this months talk she will share her vast experience of confidence coaching to help you to stop pretending and experience your own authentic confidence.

MICA is a not for profit organisation that arranges inspiring events for the local community. The talks we arrange are for every day people with an interest in personal development. The money we raise from the events are used to develop community arts projects to help connect with the local community in imaginative ways.

<description><![CDATA[Carriageworks Theatre is working closely with Proper Job Theatre Company in the ongoing development of their fresh take on the well-known tale of the original monster movie Nosferatu.

We are hosting a rehearsed reading of the script, written by Yorkshire based poet Ian McMillan. There is an original score performed live with singing.

"On the blood dark sea the ship is barely moving
There's a sail as torn as a shattered shirt
Something is aboard the ship..."

Nosferatu tells the dark and mysterious tale of the sailors in Bram Stokers novel Dracula, as they journey from Varna to Whitby with an unknown cargo.

This is a fantastic chance to be one of the first to see a new groundbreaking piece of theatre, feeding into the shaping and impression of the play, which will embark on a national tour in 2015. We need your feedback so please join us for an evening of blood, danger and art!

Proper Job Theatre Company is based in the North of England creating and touring new work as well as large-scale theatre events. Proper Job are passionate about continuously developing projects that excite us, fire our curiosity and expand our imagination. ]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Gillian Clarke ]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[With John Wedgewood Clarke.

We are very pleased to welcome Gillian Clarke, the National Poet of Wales, to Headingley LitFest. Gillian, to our great delight, has agreed to headline our poetry event on 20 March in the place of Jo Shapcott who is now unable to take part this year.

Gillian is a central figure in contemporary Welsh poetry and her poems have achieved widespread critical and popular acclaim. The Poetry Archive celebrates her achievements noting that: Listening to a Gillian Clarke poem is an intensely sensual experience; her use of language "concrete as it is
musical" (Times Literary Supplement) and the patterning of rhyme and alliteration combine to give the impression of a poem as an almost physical object...

Gillian Clarke was born in Cardiff and lives in Ceredigion. National Poet for Wales since 2008, she is President of TÃÂÃÂ· Newydd, the Welsh Writers Centre which she co-founded in 1990. Her work is widely studied for GCSE and A Level. She has published thirteen books for adults, and several for children as writer, translator or editor. Her first prose collection, At the Source, ap-peared in 2008. Her recent collection of poems, Ice, was short-listed for the TS Eliot Award 2012. In December 2010 she was awarded the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry, and in 2012 the Wilfred Owen Award.

John Wedgwood Clarke was born in St.Ives, Cornwall and now lives in Scarborough. He founded and ran the Beverley Literature Festival and Bridlington Poetry Festival until 2012.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Stories of a boy growing up in Warsaw. New York, 1978.

The cab driver is waiting to take him to the airport. The evening before he travels to Stockholm to collect the Nobel Prize for Literature, Isaac Bashevis Singer - a passionate, brilliant storyteller - recalls a fascinating childhood full of mystery, torment and adventure.

A Day of Pleasure is about more than a young boy growing up in a strange and exotic world; it is about growing up itself. Singer brings to life the vivid characters of pre-war Warsaw, his own character and the human conditions that affect us all.

Materials provided but bring along any stationery (and/or stamps) if you can.

There will be delicious hot vegan food.

Being in detention or prison is incredibly isolating. People are often held in detention indefinitely and it is incredibly hard to stay positive and strong. Getting a little message of hope and friendship can mean so much.

<event_title><![CDATA[Stories From The War Hospital]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[This evening, the LitFest's year-long research project based on the military hospital which was at Beckett Park, Headingley, during the First World War, comes to a climax.

The illustrated book - Stories from the War Hospital - will be officially launched, illustrated by a dramatic performance based on some of its contents.

The City of Leeds Training College had been built not long before hostilities started, and in 1914 it was established as the 2nd Northern General Hospital. Wounded soldiers replaced trainee teachers, and the Red Cross flag was hoisted above what is today the James Graham Building, part of Leeds Metropolitan University.

The Performance
This will begin at 8.15pm. The performers are The Vedettes - Richard Wilcocks and three students from Performing Arts at Leeds Metropolitan University - Katharina Arnold, Charlotte Blackburn and Hannah Ferguson, who have developed the production in a series of workshops. It is based on three of the stories in the book. 'Vedettes' was one of the nicknames for women in the VAD (Voluntary Aid Detachment). It also means 'rising stars' in modern French.

<description><![CDATA[The proposed Immigration Bill - which is not yet law - is essentially a new attempt to try and introduce ID cards to the UK. It will have massive implications for:

anyone applying for asylum
international students
anyone needing hospital treatment
anyone trying to rent a house, open a bank account or get a driving licence will have to show proof of their immigration status.
anyone who doesn't look 'British'

It is an attempt to legalise the harassment witnessed last summer with the hateful 'go home' campaign and the stop checks in London.

Speakers will outline key changes to:

access to NHS
stop & search powers
housing, bank accounts, driving licence
asylum, bail, appeals
international students

Followed by workshops on how to challenge this racist law.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Ska Legends, The Selecter will celebrate their 35th anniversary with an extensive 26-date UK tour, performing their seminal debut album 'Too Much Pressure' in its entirety for the first time ever.

Iconic Ska Legends, The Selecter have announced that they will celebrate their 35th anniversary with an extensive 26-date UK tour in February, March and April 2014, performing their seminal debut album 'Too Much Pressure' in its entirety for the first time ever.

Released on the legendary 2-Tone label, 'Too Much Pressure' was a Top 5 selling album featuring a host of timeless classics, including 'Three Minute Hero', 'Missing Words' and course 'Too Much Pressure' - all of which were released on Top 40 charting singles.

The Too Much Pressure 35th Anniversary Tour will also feature an extended encore of hits and live favorites from across The Selecter's extensive 35-year spanning back catalogue, including their debut Top 10 smash hit, 'On My Radio' right up to the this year's critically acclaimed 'String Theory'.

Pauline Black says, "We thought our 35th anniversary would be the perfect time to revisit our very first album Too Much Pressure and perform it in full...for the very first time! We can't wait to get on the road to bring our message of multiculturalism from across 4 decades to venues up and down the land. See you there!"

The past few years have seen a huge resurgence in the popularity of The Selecter, with new material being released alongside a relentless touring schedule which has taken the band play numerous gigs and festivals across Europe, undertake no less than 3 trips to the USA (including being picked as the Desert Sun's highlight of the 2013 Coachella festival) and even performing as far afield as Australia and Canada.

Still as outspoken and politically articulate as ever, The Selecter are both tied to, and very proud of, their past, to the acknowledgement of 2-Tone and all that it meant to their fans and the wider music community.

Artists: The Selecter, Talisman.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[featuring Pauline Black and Gaps Hendrickson | plus guest support Talisman.

"Too Much Pressure" released by this important and influential platinum selling band in Feb 1980 remains a classic touchstone for a generation of Ska lovers and the band are excited to announce they will be playing the album in its entirety plus a selection of other much loved Selecter tracks and some new surprises at concerts throughout 2011.

Mixing punk, ska and reggae, 'Too Much Pressure' successfully reflected the social and political issues of the early Thatcher years in Britain and gave a voice to disaffected youth across the racial divide.

The Selecter fronted by the original singing duo of the female icon of the 2-tone era Pauline Black & Arthur 'Gaps' Hendrickson deliver classic hits like 'Three Minute Hero', 'Missing Words', 'On My Radio', 'James Bond' and of course 'Too Much Pressure'.

2011 saw the return of one of the most vital, visceral and important Ska acts ever. Queen of 2- Tone, Pauline Black featured prominently in BBC4's "Reggae Britannia" series, contributing to a 90 mins documentary and a live concert broadcast from The Barbican in London.

The Selecter's new 10 track album 'Made In Britain', featuring covers of Amy Winehouse's 'Back To Black' & a hugely popular anti-racist ska/reggae re-working of Woody Guthrie's 'All You Fascists Bound To Lose'- re-invented as 'Big In The Body- Small In The Mind', which was released in September 2011.

2012 saw The Selecter embark on a 32 date tour of the UK throughout the year, with many venues selling out in advance. Dec 2012 saw the band do their first ever tour of Australia which was a huge success.

2013 saw the band play another 20 dates in the UK in March and then in April the band went back to the USA for the first time in many years culminating in an appearance at the influential Coachella Festival. The band have plans to go back to the USA two more times in 2013 and plans for the Far East and South America in 2014.

Pauline Black has also written a well-received 2-Tone memoir, 'Black By Design' which has been published by 'Serpent's Tail' and released in July 2011. She made an appearance at the Edinburgh International Book Festival in August 2011. The book is released in the US in June 2012.

"'Multiculturalism rules', The Selecter'sÂ® Pauline Black says pointedly, hours after David Cameron has declared it dead. In a Midlands rude-girl suit of sharp straight lines, she brings 2-Tone's faster, jerky punk beat and the needling New Wave aggro of 'On My Radio', to which a platoon of fans jog along. - Nick Hasted, The Independent

"...a slick, attacking set from Pauline Black" - Robin Denselow, The Guardian]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Echoes Of War]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Two poets choose freely to abandon Blighty and head for the trenches. Why? Patriotism? Heroism? A death wish, maybe?

In Theatre of the Dales' script-in-hand production, Leeds playwrights Stuart Fortey and Peter Spafford explore the motives of Wilfred Owen and Edward Thomas. Neither man survived. What they wrote undoubtedly did.

On Scarborough Front by Stuart Fortey is a short two hander where Owen clashes with a retired colonel in a hotel being used as an officers' mess. As his own son is reported missing, the colonel is bitter and critical towards the young Owen who appears to have found a safe niche as Catering Secretary. But as the play develops, the men grow to a deeper understanding. The son survives, while Owen returns to the front, not for motives of patriotism, but to spur himself to write again. (The Clarence Gardens Hotel, now the Clifton, still stands on North Bay.)

The Edge of the Forest by Peter Spafford has two time scales. A brother and sister now own a house cluttered with war memorabilia - their father's legacy. She wants to sell up, he wants to cling to the past. In fact he has recently become agoraphobic after a mugging incident. The arrival of an estate agent with an eye for the sister pushes things to a climax. The boy is obsessed by Thomas. For long stretches he identifies with him in his mind, imagining his sister and the agent as Edward's wife Helen and their friend the charming and persuasive Robert Frost. Edward, like him, is torn between staying where he is and venturing forth into action.

<description><![CDATA[If any of you have heard his mixes or caught him on the Boiler Room, you'll know that Jay throws it down right. He's a passionate, energetic and intuitive DJ who won't be caught standing still behind the turntables.

Making waves in production too, Daniel's debut 12" recently landed on Theo Parrish's Sound Signature: It's four tracks displaying that signature motor city rawness, combined with a depth of musical knowledge well beyond his years. We can't wait to hear more.

Artists / Speakers: Jay Daniel.]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Create a Vision Board]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[... for the next chapter of your life.

Before you set out on a journey it helps to know where you're going. If not, you're going to end up SOMEWHERE . . . just not where you want to be.

What if your elusive dreams took shape before your eyes? What would you discover? What could you then bring into your life for real?

Vision boards are a fabulous technique for focussing our energy and commitment on what's important. Then we get to have more of it in our lives. Pictures, words, photos, lines from poems, colour - they all help to create a powerful reminder of what you want in your future.

Making them in a workshop is fun, playful, stress free and collaborative. You get to share ideas and tell other people about yours. That's the added extra of doing this with others - you get to say it out loud as well.

"I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I lived just the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well." Diane Ackerman

This workshop will suit anyone who is
- Seeking a different way to approach the new year.
- Wanting to look at your life as a whole and create greater fulfilment and richness in it.
- Has an idea for a specific project you want to create (and maybe you keep putting it on the back burner).
- Planning something big like a wedding, new business idea or retirement.

This special workshop retreat is for a maximum of 6 people, book early to be sure you're one of them. How about booking a place with your partner and creating a shared vision for your future.

During the workshop you'll
- Plug into the power of your dreams.
- Get in contact with your wisest inner self and use that inner knowing to create your vision from.
- Be coached to explore that vision so it becomes richer and more vibrant.
- Create your own vision board using a collage of images, words and colour.
- Talk about the significance of the elements of your vision so you get to hear yourself claim it out loud.
- Plan how you're going to use your board to keep focussed on what's important to you.
- Spend a day in a warm, cosy home, eat well, share laughter and have some playful fun cutting out!

" My partner and I did this course with Tilla - this weekend we have a romantic retreat by the sea to complete our shared vision board!"   Helen Collier, Money Coach HarmoneyLife

All you need is comfy clothes, a desire to create your own life and an open mind. The desire to have that fun will also come in useful! This is Blue Peter for adults!

I'll provide all the materials, and if you want to bring along old magazines to share around that'll be great.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Crow_Sourcing by Andy Deck, featured in the Digital Zoo exhibition, is an installation that calls attention to the echoes of the wild in language. Andy invites audiences to help build a collection of their favourite animal idioms and expressions using social media and an installation.

To accompany Crow_Sourcing, a series of 60-90 minute creative, fun workshops will feature across three days. Children aged between 6 and 11 years old are invited to explore art, technology and nature.

In groups, the children will be able to create absurd and unusual creatures using craft materials and stencils, record animal sound bites, and explore language to describe their creatures, making funny and nonsensical names for them. They can then take their creations home or display at the venue.

Crow_Sourcing is part of Digital Zoo - Life from the world wild web, London's Furtherfield and CultureCode's groundbreaking national touring exhibition at Trinity Leeds shopping centre.

Digital Zoo is supported by Arts Council England through the Strategic Touring programme.

In the 1960's The Grove Inn was a well known meeting place for the Irish community in Leeds, particularly before going to the dances that took place in the now long gone St Francis Dance Hall in Holbeck.

<description><![CDATA[Join Maggie Mash and her guests for a special house event.

War and Peace is a heartening and moving celebration of the strength of the human spirit, told through music, poetry, prose and performance.

Actress Ruth Sillers will be talking about and performing extracts from her own audiobook compilation, War Girls, recently favourably reviewed in the Daily Telegraph. Encore!

Leeds based singer and actress Maggi Stratford and her accompanist Daniel Bowater, will be adding a French flavour to the afternoon with a programme of chansons that typify the spirit that kept the French going during the Occupation of France in the Second World War. There will also be stirring readings from local writers and performers to fit in with this theme of resistance and survival.

Bring your berets!

<description><![CDATA[For many people, the First World War is indelibly associated with the poetry of Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon and Rupert Brooke. Yet the poetic output of British, Dominion and American troops was far more extensive than the well known works of the best known poets.

This event will explore some of the lesserknown poems and poetry, including works by A.E. Mackintosh and Alan Seegar, as well as poetry published in hospital fundraising magazines such as The Gazette of the Third London General Hospital.

Dr Jessica Meyer will discuss how such poetry has informed her own work as a historian of the First World War and the continuing cultural impact of war poetry on British understandings of the war and its centenary commemoration.

<description><![CDATA[A Keep Streets Live Fundraiser.

The Keep Streets Live Campaign exists to keep our public spaces open to informal performances of art & music. Street culture is under severe threat across the UK but particularly in Camden, perhaps London's most musical borough, where a new law criminalises street musicians and threatens them with large fines and instrument confiscations, and the sale of musical instruments to pay fines. We are crowd-sourcing the funds to challenge this decision in the High Court to send a strong message to local authorities and national government: Support street culture, don't strangle it!

Our friends at Hansas Restaurant in Leeds, winners of the prestigious Cobra award for "Best UK Indian Vegetarian Restaurant" have offered us their restaurant for a unique fundraiser: a delicious three course meal, music between courses from the remarkably talented Beccy Owen, The Jamie Fletcher Band, Jonny Walker and many more, punctuating your culinary delight with melody. Between courses and performances there will be the obligatory raffle and we are delighted to announce that an expert in antiques and professional auctioneer has volunteered their services for what will be the inaugural interactive Keep Streets Live Auction... If you have ideas for the auction feel free to bring them along, we hope to auction off poems, songs, house gigs, luxury beauty treatments, guitars and much more besides!

BEARFOOT BEWARE
Heading the bill and helping curate the evening are Leeds' finest exponent of post-hardcore people, Bearfoot Beware. I am sure you all know who they are and what they do but if not, they sound like something in between Faraquet, hoovers and fishing and now are evolving to more of a darker blend of early nineties post something like Unwound. Minus all the ludicrous references, they are really good and sound very nice at a gig with a beer or a glass of fine wine.
There are loads of things on the internet about them. Find it....]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Little Voices is a series of fun, 45 minute workshops, where adults, tots and babies can be creative together in a friendly environment.  You'll have the chance to sing songs, explore instruments, play games and generally have fun with music.   It's also a great opportunity for socialising and making new friends!

Sessions aim to introduce music, drama and movement at the earliest stages of a child's development to spark a life-long connection with the arts.  They also provide the ideal environment in which adults and infants can bond through creative play.

Little Voices takes place every Monday during term time at the Howard Assembly Room, Leeds.  There are two sessions each week, at 10am and 11:15am.  Both sessions will share a refreshment break from 10.45-11.15am which you are invited to join before/after your session.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Direct from the West End, the acknowledged master of psychological illusion returns to the stage with his latest show, Derren Brown: Infamous, demonstrating once again why Derren is one of the world's most renowned live performers; a dark manipulator of magic and mind control.

For Infamous, a more 'personal' show, Derren is re-united with his close collaborator and friend, actor/writer Andy Nyman.

Derren says 'Now we've joined forces again, we're very eager to make this show feel different. There was something of a template we followed with all the shows, which worked very well. It's rather exciting and scary leaving that behind. This one should certainly have a different tone, and will mix things up a bit for those who have seen the others on TV or live'.

Infamous is Derren's sixth show since 2003. He has toured every year since then and has been watched by an estimated audience of over 2 million people. He has won two prestigious Olivier Awards, for Something Wicked This Way Comes (2006) and Svengali (2012), and confesses that touring is still his favourite thing to do.

Martini  Plaisir d'amour

Andriessen  Sonata da Chiesa

Joplin  Rag-time Waltz: Pleasant Moments

Glass  Satyagraha

Mushel  Nocturne

Bull  Rondo in G

Yet another programme promising much fascinating music making for truly compulsive listening. The recitals by Benjamin Saunders are invariably a real highlight of our concert year in Leeds and he begins this year with the Concerto in G minor for solo organ by Matthew Camidge, of the famed York Minster 18th/19th century musical dynasty. Hendrik Andriessen's powerful and finely wrought Sonata da Chiesa is at the heart of an imaginatively conceived concert encompassing a vast diversity of music from England's own 16th century keyboard virtuoso John Bull through Scott Joplin and Georgi Mushel to Philip Glass in our own day.

<event_title><![CDATA[Johnny Marr]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[The early 1980s weren't the best of times to be an aspiring guitar player. Twenty years earlier, the head of Decca records, Dick Rowe, had made the biggest A&R gaff in pop history with the legendary clanger "Guitar groups are on their way out, Mr Epstein". But in 1982, Rowe's apocalyptic prophecy suddenly sounded frighteningly real. After the initial roar and storm of punk, British pop music had succumbed to a synthesizer-driven pursuit of new waves and new romanticisms. In an age of Vienna's, Tainted Love's and Too Shy's, the pure sound of six-stringed, melodic pop - be it as amorous as The Beatles, as lascivious as The Stones or as giddy as T.Rex - was fast becoming a lost cause with few willing to fight its corner.

That all changed with Johnny Marr.]]></description>

Leeds No Borders have visited Calais a number of times in the last year to drop off donations, cook & hang out with migrants stuck at the border. We will be heading out again soon so this is a great introduction for anyone thinking of joining us or just wanting to know more. There's recently been an increase in fascist attacks in Calais and a crack down on anyone trying to shelter in the many empty buildings there.

Grieg  Holberg Suite Op 40, No

Rachmaninov  Variations on a theme of Corelli

Shostakovich  Prelude and Fugue No 24

Ravel  Le tombeau de Couperin

The final programme of our season explores the old and the new, how composers throughout the ages have been inspired by older styles to create something new.

Many composers have written sets of 24 Preludes & Fugues, one for each of the twenty four major and minor keys, many of whom were inspired by the two sets of Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier. Tonight we hear Bach's first Prelude & Fugue and Shostakovich's last. Grieg's Holberg Suite and Ravel's Le tombeau de Couperin are 19 and 20th century works respectively which both use the form of the Baroque dance suite as their inspiration. The Holberg Suite was written in 1884 to commemorate the birth 200 years previously of the playwright Holberg, whilst Ravel dedicated each movement of the suite to the memory of friends who died during the First World War.

<description><![CDATA[Gala Concert by Choral Scholars of King's College Cambridge
includes former Minster Chorister & Choral Scholar Toby Ward from Bramhope in the line-up

Event generously sponsored by Mr Albert Andrews
Special Concert in aid of the Minster Choir Fund

Toby Ward of Bramhope, Leeds, was a boy chorister and choral scholar in the choir of Leeds Parish Church (now Leeds Minster). After completing his A level examinations at Fulneck School, Toby was awarded the tenor Choral Scholarship at Gloucester Cathedral, for the academic year 2013/14. In October 2014, Toby took up a tenor choral scholarship in the choir of King's College, Cambridge.

Toby's musical talent was spotted early, at Bramhope Primary School, and he received piano lessons from the late Michael Sykes of Pool-in-Wharfedale. After a short period at Abbey Grange Church of England High School, Toby was awarded a music scholarship to Fulneck School.

Toby, in his first year at King's reading music, is one of fifteen choral scholars who comprise the back row of the famous King's College Choir, formed in 1516. Following a long tradition, the scholars form a touring group now known as The King's Men, performing regularly around Britain, and recently as far afield as North America, Australia and Hong Kong.

Toby said:
It will be a huge pleasure to return to Leeds Minster, the scene of my early musical education. It was a concert by The King's Men at the minster which inspired me to apply to King's in the first place, so I hope we can help inspire the next generation of the Minster's young musicians, while delivering an entertaining program of music from 500 years ago to the present day.

Dr Simon Lindley, Master of the Music at Leeds Minster said:
We have welcomed the King's choral scholars to Leeds on a number of occasions in the recent past and the students have been of great assistance in raising the profile of choral music here at the Minster. It's obviously particularly special having Toby return this year as a current King's alumnus. Minster Parishioners, along with staff, parents and students at Toby's schools have expressed considerable interest in attending, as have members and friends of Minster-based St Peter's Singers in which Toby sang for a number of years as a teenager, graduating eventually to the solo ranks.
The King's Men is the close harmony group formed from the Choral Scholars of the Choir of King's College, Cambridge. As Choral Scholars they follow the daily routine of Chapel services throughout term, as well as undertaking a busy concert and recording schedule in the vacations.

The Choir is, of course, most famous for the broadcast of the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols on radio each Christmas, and its companion programme, Carols from King's, on BBC television.

The King's Men, however, functions separately from the main Choir, and is run entirely by the members of the group itself. It performs regularly around Britain, and has performed as far afield as North America, Australia and Hong Kong.]]></description>

It builds on the philosophy of Cafe Scientifique to take ideas out of professional settings like universities, laboratories and clinics to make them accessible to people in their everyday life.

Like Cafe Scientifique there are trained professionals to provide a resource to the cafe, but no lectures or seminars. Instead ideas are dropped into to the group to stimulate thought and discussion and people are invited to bring along issues they want to talk about, discuss, explore or find help with.

Each month we tackle a different theme, listed on our website: www.spark.uk.net/cafe-psychologique ]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Gallery Munro House opens it doors for something special....

A one - off film screening of Daisy Asquith's 'Crazy About One Direction' and director discussion.

Directioners are a rare breed of fan. Connected to their idols through social media, they have a love and dedication like no other. These are the girls that heart One Direction.

Daisy Asquith's documentary reveals what it truly means to be a Directioner, the lengths they will go to meet 1D, and how these teenage girls are united in their love of the most popular boy band in the world.

From Milton Keynes to Glasgow, Directioners dedicate their lives and their money to following Harry, Zayn, Niall, Liam and Louis. They camp out before and after concerts, book into hotels and watch Twitter constantly to get an idea of where the boys might be.

With their love of 1D being compared to drug addiction, the belief that Twitter is like a form of prayer communication with the boys, and girls getting braces and tattoos just to have something in common with their heart-throbs, is this the future of the fan?

Daisy Asquith will be present during this event to answer any questions.

Please enter via Cafe 164 where hot and cold refreshments will be available to purchase. Screening will start at 7pm.

This event is part of an exhibition, 'Saturday Girl' by acclaimed photographer Casey Orr.

<description><![CDATA[SEIZE Leeds presents: OVERTIME : Art and the Office

Opening Night - Wednesday 26th March 7pm, All Welcome

Situated in Leeds' busy financial district, OVERTIME brings together a diverse group of both emerging and more established practitioners from across the country to explore the differences between the office and the artist's studio.

Often seen as a bureaucratic environment, offices are associated with systemized tasks, the management of data and pro rata salaries, but rarely unregulated creative play. This exhibition seeks to use the unexpected friction generated by placing the work of art in the office to interrogate fixed attitudes towards working practices more generally.

Participating artists & collectives are:
Lily Ackroyd-Willoughby
Mike Ainsworth
Anachron-Gen
Alice Bradshaw
Lydia Catterall
Spike Dennis
Natalie Drenth
Emma Hardaker
Phill Hopkins
Edward Hurst
Luc Jones
Ellie MacGarry
Bess Martin
Tom McGinn
Emma Moody-Smith
Julia Miorin
Shanie Mor
OFFCUT collaborative
Leo Plumb
Ned Pooler
Stanley Quaia
Alec Shepley
Will Turner
Philip Welding
Matt Wheeldon

SEIZE Leeds is an artist-led organisation that works to engage and support emerging and mid-career artists both regionally and nationally through a programme of ambitious temporary art shows and events. SEIZE works with vacant spaces in-situ to produce exciting and accessible exhibitions that explore ideas relevant to each site and promote talent.

After his opera singing turn saw him emerge the winner on Born To Shine (ITV1) Jason put his new found talent into practice joining Alfie Boe on tour prior to a well-received run in the critically acclaimed hit west-end musical Sweeney Todd alongside Michael Ball and Imelda Staunton. However, his comedy bones weren't completely idle as he enjoyed appearances on QI (BBC Two), Big Fat Quiz of the Year (Channel 4), and Comedy World Cup (Channel 4).

Jason said: "Some of you might think I've had a career change what with all the opera and musical theatre I've been doing lately. Not a chance, I'm excited to be getting back to what I really love the most - stand up!"

Stand up sets on 'Live at the Apollo' (BBC One), 'Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow' (BBC One) and 'The Royal Variety Performance' (ITV1, 2009) have all helped establish Jason as a nationally known comic, a position which made him the ideal host of ITV's reality comedy competition, Show Me the Funny. A second series of his hilarious creation 'Walk on the Wild Side' (BBC One) aired in 2010, and Jason has hosted 'Comedy Rocks with Jason Manford' (ITV1) and been a regular panelist on two series of 'Odd One In' (ITV1).

"Effortlessly entertaining" - Evening Standard

"He's blessed with the sort of laid-back charm and sharp turn of phrase you can't manufacture" - Daily Telegraph

"Manford retains an affably jovial demeanour that makes him warmly enjoyable company." - Chortle]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The lights are bright. The glamour's ripe. The glitter is almost too much to bear as we battle through a haze of artificial smoke. You're invited to play your part in the game show of the century.

Guided by hosts from the Playhouse to a secret location,
It Burns It All Clean takes you on a safari through the social landscape of the UK. Fuelled by fakery and frustration, this is a journey into the unemployment system - a very modern hell.

Who's got the gold? Who'll find the finish line? Who's job is it,
anyway?

Lurid, caustic and a little bit silly: a performance about our minds and our societies unravelling.

Commissioned by West Yorkshire Playhouse, in association with Fierce.

This is a promenade performance which takes place off site. Meet at the Playhouse and be guided to the location.]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Sodium Laureth Suplhate/The Gallery Is Now Closed]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Leeds based artists Fred Pepper and Helen Dryden are jointly exhibiting at private residence The Crooked House (in Burley, Leeds).

Helen's exhibition 'Sodium Laureth Sulphate' consists of mixed media paintings and a digital projection.

Her process is spontaneous and instinctive, using media such as acrylics on canvas, boards and cardboard; watercolours, felt tip pens, ribbons and gems. Using imagery from her subconscious, intuitive mark making, and reacting to found pictures and music, Helen creates an uncertain world, sometimes confusing, wondering, atmospheric and difficult to identify.

Fred's exhibition 'The Gallery Is Now Closed' features a display of his ongoing movie monster monoprint series, accompanied by a loop of the video-collage Wastin' Arrers and the sound piece Mr. Leech's Institution by Lynden St. John for Octopus Collective, for which the artist provided voice performance.

Fred Pepper works in an illustrative style and within a narrative tradition. His practice centres on drawing and printmaking, but he also makes forays into the territories of performance, sculpture, digital media and painting.
He was born a Sagittarius on a Woden's Day in a Year of the Wood Rabbit.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The final film in our Modern Monochrome season, Javor Gardev's Bulgarian crime drama, ZIFT, tells the story of Moth - a petty criminal wrongfully convicted of murder.

Jailed shortly before the Bulgarian communist coup of 1944, he now finds himself in a new and alien world - the totalitarian Sofia of the 1960s. His first night of freedom draws the map of a diabolical city full of decaying neighbourhoods, gloomy streets and a bizarre parade of characters.

Like his namesake to a flame, it is not long before Moth is drawn back to his old habits. Part La Haine-part Chopper, Zift is both brutal and funny, romantic while packing one hell of a punch.

Our feature presentation will be preceded by a selection of short films plus a preview of our upcoming African season.

Tea, coffee and homemade cake will be available on arrival.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Try and imagine being dead. It's cold and dark and silent. There's nothing. Nothing at all. You can't see anything, smell anything, taste anything. Also, you're not there. Can you contemplate the total absence of you? Go on, try... no... you're still there aren't you? This should be easy: it's something you experienced for the first 13 billion years of the Universe and yet the prospect of returning to that state of nothingness is unimaginable and fills us with fear. And with all these thoughts swirling around in your mortal and decayable brain, it's time for some comedy!

<description><![CDATA[Hannah Bruce & Company

This building is full of secrets, whispered into cracks in the wall. Around hidden corners, dreams surge against the rocks. This building is the product of your imagination.

The Claim is an atmospheric encounter with West Yorkshire
Playhouse's hidden spaces. Glimpse the subterranean depths of the theatre; wrap yourself in bricks and mortar; and stake your claim to a place of your own imagining.

Hannah Bruce & Company create events that respond to specific places, immersing audiences in unique performance
journeys. Using the latest in digital technology you're invited to explore a building you thought you knew, uncover its deepest secrets and be amazed at what lies behind closed doors.

Commissioned by West Yorkshire Playhouse, in association with Northern School of Contemporary Dance.

<description><![CDATA[Ring is a sound journey in complete darkness and an antidote to choice. Wearing headphones that amplify every intimate detail, you are transported to another room very similar to the one you entered... But in this room you have been recognised.

At times seductive, at times unnerving, Ring places the audience at the heart of a thrilling attack on their own identity.

<description><![CDATA[A razor sharp and darkly comic exploration of our universal desire to win.

Three intrepid contestants compete in a series of games, from the hilariously stupid to the arbitrary and downright heartbreaking. Chris, Jess and Ira fearlessly do whatever it takes to win - to please you, the audience. They are also eager to share their stories, perspectives and awkward dances in-between.

Anarchic, thoughtful and ultimately moving, Gym Party speaks to anyone who frets about the state of the world and how we treat each other - then gets distracted by a dumb celebrity tweet.

"One marvellously unusual hour... Gym Party finds the sweet spot between pure play, socio-political satire and personal confession... sharp, silly and surprisingly tender" - **** The Times]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Cape Wrath]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA["After he retired, my Grandad went on a trip from the Midlands up to Cape Wrath, the most north-westerly point of his native Scotland. He sat, looked at the sea, and thought about his life. Then he got up and went home. Over 20 years later, I got on a coach and followed in his footsteps. This is what I learned."

Third Angel presents a story of family, of fellow travellers, of whisky and chocolate, of the longest bus journey in Britain, told to an audience of just 14. Completely sold out for its run at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2013, Cape Wrathis heartfelt, moving and funny. A compellingly intimate journey to the edge of the island.

<description><![CDATA[On this guided linear walk Tolkienist Claire Randall will discuss local landscape and linguistic features around Headingley that Professor JRR Tolkien will have known from his time in Leeds just after the Great War (1920-25), which provocatively suggest themselves as inspirations and influences on his creation of Middle Earth. We shall also visit several of the houses where he lived, contextualising his Leeds period and exploring aspects of his mythology, which was already well developed at this time.

This walk is 4.5 miles and finishes at the West Park Cafe; for
optional refreshments.

<description><![CDATA[The Far Headingley Village Society & Headingley
LitFest Literary Scarecrow Festival.

Enter the festival. Follow the trail. Go to the scarecrow meet.

All scarecrows must have some sort of literary connection,
however loose - e.g. a character (human, animal or scarecrow) in a book, poem or play.

There will be an end-of-trail 'scarecrow meet' at the community orchard near St Chad's church on Sunday 6 April from 2pm onwards.

Or for only &pound;1 you can just follow the scarecrow trail from 29 to 30 March, see how many scarecrows you can find and help to judge the winning entries. Buy your scarecrow trail map from HEART, Headingley library or local shops or check
the FHVS website for other sources.

Keep up to date with all the latest scarecrow news at

There will be poems, there will be stories and there will be conversation.

I Wish I Was Lonely is the new show from Fringe-First winners Hannah Jane Walker and Chris Thorpe (following 2011'sThe Oh F*ck Moment) that asks how much of ourselves we've given up to the new Gods in our pockets.

If you've never thought poetry is your bag, and the thought of going to a poetry performance fills you with horror... think again! Char March is a multi-award-winning poet and playwright, and her poetry performances are a rip-roaring mix of stand-up and emotional roller-coaster - she'll have you crying with laughter and roaring with tears. (And she's the judge for our Open Mic - straight after her performance - so come along and get some tips!)  Char has supported Otley WordFeast from the start, and says:  "I've performed at hundreds of LitFests around Britain and abroad, and Otley WordFeast is definitely the friendliest, the most supportive, and the most fun one - by miles!

<description><![CDATA[The anguishing story of Yerma, a woman who suffers heart breaking social torment of a childless marriage forcing her to commit a horrific and irrevocable act set the scene for this powerful production.  Lorca's savage yet poetical lyrical play set in rural patriarchal and religiously repressive Spain is transposed to an inner city British Islamic community.

Amina Khayyam, principal dancer and choreographer will look to share the emotions and experiences of many women in childless marriages, and the communities they are based in, through Kathak Dance. Live musicians Debasish Mukherjee (tabla), Lucy Rahman (vocals) James Barralet (cello) Tarun Jasani (sarod) will add to the narrative, enabling boundaries to be crossed and explored of a topic that is a very personal one, but touches the hearts of everyone.

In association with the Amina Khayyam Dance Company.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Shostakovish had a born dramatist's sense... The New Babylon score is full of moments in which the music directly, unambiguously accompanies the screen' NY Times
Trauberg and Kozintsev's great masterpiece of Soviet avant-garde cinema is a powerful story of the 1871 Paris commune told through the eyes of a shop-girl working in the New Babylon emporium.

Scored by the then 23 year old Dmitri Shostakovich, the film is accompanied live by the Orchestra of Opera North. Bursting with jazz and cabaret inspired music, this is Shostakovich at his most satirical. Together, the film and music reflect both on revolutionary Russia and the enduring Russian fascination with Paris.

Film courtesy of European Film Philharmonic Institute.
Music courtesy of Sikorski Musikverlage
Dir.Trauberg and Kozintsev; USSR; 1929; 96 mins]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Madame Lucinda's Wonder Show]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[This show is for anyone who ever had a dream. Lose yourself in the thrilling world of spectacle and the macabre and wake up with fresh eyes.

Ever dreamt of running away with the circus?

With moments of high pathos, circus spectacle and powerful narrative Rogue Theatre tells the stories of three lost souls who sign up to run away with Madame Lucinda, mother, father, devil, angel, alter ego and ring master.

The show mixes the bright lights of the circus with moments of intimacy, to tell the stories of each of the characters and how they ended up at their crossroads where Madame Lucinda found them. As the play unfolds, the audience shares the secret moments between characters backstage, alone in the dressing rooms, gaining insight into their dreams, fears and heartache:

Sirus, formerly Mr Johnson, the frustrated office clerk who lived in his imagination but failed to see the subtle beauty of the world around him

LoLo, circus orphan, whose father was killed in a tragically comic circus accident involving a flying pig

Svetlana, the dancing doll, destined to live a half-life with a broken heart trapped inside her wooden exterior.

With live music by the original musical director Ben Sutcliffe, mesmerising vocals, poetry and text by Annamaria Murphy (Kneehigh Theatre (Trystan and Yseult and Red Shoes), Radio 4, National Theatre), illusion, magic, side splitting comedy, ballet, whip cracking, explosive physical performance and powerful narrative.

Journey through the doors of the imagination into a world of mystery, spectacle and horror!

Marvel at the exquisite heartache, the torturous hilarity and breathtaking magic.

<event_title><![CDATA[Black Moth]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[plus guest supports... Antlered Man and The Witch Hunt.

Black Moth are Harriet Bevan - vocals, Jim Swainston - guitar, Nico Carew - guitar, Dave Vachon - bass, and Dom McCready plays drums.

Formed in 2010 out of the ashes of a Leeds-based garage rock band, the band were seduced by the brutal and hypnotic lure of the riff, to emerge translucent skinned and bleary eyed from their cocoon as the ferocious kick-ass heavy rock outfit that is Black Moth.

Taking a powerful chunk of influence from proto-punk acts such as Iggy and the Stooges, Motorhead and early Alice Cooper as well as a sliver of 90s grunge and stoner rock, Black Moth draw out the darker elements and combine them with the heaving riffs of heavy metal giants, Pentagram and Black Sabbath, with hooks so sharp you could hang a corpse on them. They also look to more current acts such as the Melvins, Sleep and Electric Wizard for inspiration, though singer, Harriet Bevan, still maintains a vocal style that evokes the haunting psychedelia of Grace Slick and psych-Satanist, Jinx Dawson from Coven: the woman responsible for the "sign of the horns" in rock'n'roll.

Songs that the band have honed and crafted in the mighty maelstrom that is the Leeds heavy rock scene, have been rippin' 'em up live not only in Yorkshire but everywhere they've played. Now all they needed was to be brought to vivid screaming life on record.

Enter Mr Jim Sclavunos, the multi talented Grinderman and Bad Seed, not to mention the superbaaad connoisseur of the mixing console, fresh from producing the storming second Jim Jones Revue album.

One of their shows was all it took. "Black Moth reminds me of my misspent youth" he said.]]></description>

We invite you to imagine being in love, and all the many different meanings that might have. We invite you to imagine yourself in Paris. We invite you to imagine yourself looking up and unexpectedly catching the eye of the person sitting opposite you.

<event_title><![CDATA[The Passion Of Christ]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[The Cantata The Passion of Christ was composed by Lake-District born composer Sir Arthur Somervell's exactly a century ago in 1914. The Passion follows very much in the traditions of Stainer [The Crucifixion of 1887] and Maunder [Olivet to Calvary of 1904].

The passion narrative unfolds mainly in recitative drawn from Gospel texts, while solo arias and "choral meditations", with words probably by Somervell himself, reflect on the action. As in the Stainer and Maunder pieces, there are hymns for all to sing. Somervell's music is throughout reflective and beautiful and at times exquisite.

"It is, truly, a forgotten masterpiece," said conductor Dr Simon Lindley, "I remember obtaining a copy some years ago from a colleague who was organist of Holy Trinity Church in Boar Lane, and have been wanting for decades to give the piece an airing. The centenary year of its first performance provides us with an excellent opportunity!"]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Brendan Grace]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Ireland's family comedy grand master for over 40 years.

Amazing Grace is a catch phrase often applied to Irish Comedian Brendan Grace and indeed very true in many respects. The genial and much loved family comedian is celebrating 41 years in comedy and is now more popular than at any time in his career and what an illustrious career that has been..

Forty years ago when the 20 year old Dubliner set off on his solo career he could never have envisaged the road of life that lay ahead. Two years later a Geordie song called Cushy Butterfield sailed to No 1 in the Irish charts and the rest is history.

Brendan's latest show features some brand new material and some 'Old Favourites' from his vast repertoire over the last 41 years. His sense of timing and ability to read an audience is without equal. A brilliant character actor, his 'Bottler' character is legendary and is now featured at every performance.

Jack has also fronted many of his own bands and recorded numerous solo albums. He has also worked as session man with the likes of Lou Reed (Berlin) and Frank Zappa, with whom Jack co-wrote Apostrophe, which became Frank's biggest selling album.

<description><![CDATA[Have you ever had a dream in which everything was better?

Not just a dream of flying, or of winning the lottery, or of amazing sex with your favourite boyband.

A dream of a better here and now. More love. More laughter. More change.

A glimpse of a better life. Not just for you, but for everyone.

Storyteller and theatre maker Chris Goode has been trying to hang on to a dream: one particular glimpse, from one rainy night in June 2012. Trying to understand what made it so hard to wake up.

Welcome to a big, ambitious creative project called Albemarle, about the dreams we have and the hopes that speak through them. The final piece won't be completed until 2015, but in The Albemarle Sketchbook, Chris Goode & Company will be sharing with an audience for the first time some of the stuff they've made so far.]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[The Men]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[After spending much of 2011 and 2012 on the road, including a trip upstate to write and record New Moon, their fourth full-length in as many years, The Men needed a break. They decided to take the winter of 2012 off to work on new material in Brooklyn. The converted founding member Mark Perro's bedroom in Bushwick into a practice space and rehearsed there nearly every day for three months, cutting more than 40 demos. By the end of that winter, the Men had pared that crop of songs down to 13. With their plans to take a break foiled by their own work ethic, they decided to record those songs before New Moon came out. They booked two days at Brooklyn's Strange Weather studios, clocked in, and tracked all 13 songs entirely live, even including a horn section.

Eight songs from those sessions made the final cut for The Men's new LP, Tomorrow's Hits. This is their first album recorded in a high-end studio and, appropriately, the result is their most high fidelity album to date. That being said, it is still an incredibly straightforward record. Tomorrow's Hits is a concise collection of songs that nonetheless expands the band's ever-evolving musical palette. It's full of genre-bending risks, but it reinforces the overarching theme that has come to define its makers: The Men are a great rock band.]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Leeds Young Film Festival 2014]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Looking for something exciting for all the family to do this Easter? Leeds Young Film Festival 2014 is a perfect way for young people to enjoy the Easter holidays with their families - at a fantastic price.

There are films, events, animation and filmmaking workshops, and activities ideal for young people. There will be plenty for older audiences including a Teen Gala, 25th Anniversary screenings of cinema classics and some of the most popular films from the 27th Leeds International Film Festival too.

The full festival programme will feature screenings and events at venues including the Hyde Park Picture House, Everyman Leeds and Leeds Town Hall but we are already very pleased to announce a screening of the new film Horizon Beautiful (pictured), a wonderful story about a 12 year old Ethiopian street kid who discovers something more important than fulfilling his dream of becoming a professional footballer.

On Saturday 5 April we have an extra-special Scooby Doo event for audiences aged three and up. There will be lots of Scooby Doo related activities, together with a screening of the animated film Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase in which Scooby and the gang are trapped inside a video game and must defeat a phantom virus. A real-life Mystery Machine will be making an appearance at the event so you can have your photo taken in it with Scooby Doo himself!

We will welcome very special guest David Dimbleby to the 2014 Leeds Young Filmmaker Golden Owls Awards, an Oscars style ceremony for young filmmakers aged between three and 19, at Leeds Town Hall on Wednesday 2 April. Hyde Park Picture House will host The INDIs (Independent Directions) Awards on Monday 7 April, the UK's only film competition which solely champions and celebrates the talent of the UK's independent filmmakers under 25.

Come and be a part of all of this and more for exceptional value for money.

Leeds Young Film Festival is presented by MediaFish and Leeds City Council. MediaFish is a cooperative of young people aged 14 - 19 from Leeds that are facilitated by Leeds Young Film. MediaFish are involved in the organisation, programme and marketing of the Leeds Young Film Festival and provide a variety of film screenings, workshops and masterclasses for all ages year round.

<event_title><![CDATA[Pygmalion]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Alistair McGowan as Henry Higgins in Pygmalion, by George Bernard Shaw. With Rula Lenska and Jamie Foreman.

A major revival of one of the best-loved plays of the 20th Century.

Alistair McGowan leads an established company of actors in a centenary year production of Shaw's enduring masterpiece directed by Tony award-winning David Grindley.

Pygmalion is one of theatre's most entertaining and beguiling explorations of gender and class and is perhaps best known as the inspiration for the musical 'My Fair Lady'. The aristocratic and pompous Professor Henry Higgins (made famous by Rex Harrison) makes a bet with his friend Colonel Pickering that he can transform the manners and speech of Cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle and pass her off as a society lady. Packed with a host of larger than life characters including Alfred Doolittle and lovelorn Freddy Eynsford-Hill, Pygmalion remains one of Shaw's most popular plays and a classic British drama; full of his trademark wit, style and humour.

BAFTA award-winning Alistair McGowan stars in this major new revival of Shaw's enduring masterpiece. He is regarded as one of the most talented people working in entertainment today; an impressionist, comic and writer he has established himself as a formidable actor in recent years receiving critical acclaim for several West End appearances including Little Shop of Horrors, for which he received an Olivier Award nomination.  Rula Lenska joins Alistair to play Mrs Higgins and Jamie Foreman will play Alfred Doolittle.  Rula is a one of our leading stage and television actors with appearances in all major TV series including her role as Claudia in Coronation Street. Jamie Foreman has over thirty film credits to his name including Layer Cake and Polanski's Oliver Twist.   His television credits include Derek Branning in Eastenders.

"The perfect comedy of ideas...I could have watched all night and still have watched some more" Daily Telegraph

"Eliza Doolittle is one of the most credible and lovable working class girls ever to grace the stage" Sunday Times

"A marvellous play" Mail on Sunday

"Both more radical and much funnier than Lerner and Loewe's romantic musical" Guardian

Directed by David Grindley]]></description>

Groups of young people from ten schools across Leeds were inspired by the Anthony Browne illustration exhibition at Leeds City Museum in 2013. They worked with an artist and responded in their own way to Anthony's work and to the works at Leeds Art Gallery. Come and have a look at the fabulous works they produced!

Six primary schools and four secondary schools were involved in the project from September 2013, and each of the ten schools has hosted an exhibition of all the students work in their school or local community. The young artists worked with curators and learning staff from the Gallery to talk about curatorship and the young people then selected the works you see on display at the Gallery to represent their school.

Been inspired? Want to be involved in creating artworks, or find out more? Contact Leeds Art Gallery on city.art.gallery@leeds.gov.uk]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Tim Hecker (Canada, Kranky) + Karen Gwyer (Opal Tapes) + Stamina Nudes  ]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Tim Hecker (Canada, Kranky)
Tim Hecker is a Canadian-based musician and sound artist, born in Vancouver. Since 1996, he has produced a range of audio works for Kranky, Alien8, Mille Plateaux, Room40, Force Inc, Staalplaat, and Fat Cat. His works have been described as "structured ambient", "tectonic color plates" and "cathedral electronic music". More to the point, he has focused on exploring the intersection of noise, dissonance and melody, fostering an approach to songcraft which is both physical and emotive. The New York Times has described his work as "foreboding, abstract pieces in which static and sub-bass rumbles open up around slow moving notes and chords, like fissures in the earth waiting to swallow them whole". His Harmony in Ultraviolet received critical acclaim, including being recognized by Pitchfork as a top recording of 2006. Radio Amor was also recognized as a key recording of 2003 by Wire magazine. His work has also included commissions for contemporary dance, sound-art installations, as well as various writings. He currently resides in Montreal.His early career was characterised by an interest in techno, expressed under the Jetone moniker.

Disenchanted with this direction, Hecker began exploring more abstract notions of sound and collages, describing this process as 'very brutal, bloody, bone-crushing experiences'.[6] His current method of working involves the use of pipe organ sounds which are digitally processed and distorted. For the album Ravedeath, 1972, Hecker travelled to Iceland where together with Ben Frost, he recorded parts in a church. Live performances contain improvisations by processing organ sounds that are manipulated, with great fluctuations in volume.

Hecker collaborated on a project with Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never) who 'had a couple days blocked out in [a] Brooklyn [studio], and Tim came down. There was a day of setup, and then we just rolled tape'. This became Instrumental Tourist album where the two musicians improvised and experimented with different styles.
In addition to touring with Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Sigur R&#243;s and recording with the likes of Fly Pan Am, Hecker has also collaborated with Christof Migone, Martin T&#233;treault and Aidan Baker. He has also contributed remixes to other artists, including Isis.

Karen Gwyer (Opal Tapes)
Recording while living in London and pregnant with her son, Iowa-born producer Karen Gwyer assembled a deeply intricate collage for this mesmeric full-length debut. At times recalling the warped disco of Arthur Russell, Needs Continuum combined spiritual chanting, tumbling percussion and sci-fi synth-hum to shape a new form of cosmic techno.

<description><![CDATA[From Townsend Productions who brought you The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists in Spring 2013 comes a new play of the story of The Tolpuddle Martyrs.

We Will Be Free is the true story of George and Betsy Loveless and the Dorset farm labourers who colluded to form a Trade Union in 1834 to fight against the local landowner.

This inspirational tale tells of their conviction and transportation by an oppressive government. Their determination, solidarity and courage is presented using an entertaining theatrical style, political cartoon, puppetry and folk music.

Revealed as winners of the 2013 Glastonbury Emerging Talent Competition, they are "the kind of beguiling, affable folk band whose sound feels so natural and inviting you wonder why your first listen wasn't so much sooner".

With their sparse instrumentation, intriguing vocal harmonies, and influences as diverse as gospel, Baroque and flamenco; the Newcastle-based quartet are frequently proclaimed to be completely unique. Enchanting, spellbinding, electrifying and magical, this is a live experience to be treasured.]]></description>

Evening concert series @Seven Arts 8-11pm &pound;16/14 conc

Brandon's 2012 gig at Seven Arts was a tenor/trumpet/organ/drums affair. This time he returns with a new line up showcasing his exciting unashamedly emotional soaked- in- the-blues-tradition tenor style. Australian- born, London-resident, Brandon's playing is firmly in the hard bop tradition of Art Blakey and Horace Silver but he's no mere copyist.- Jack Massaryk in the Evening Standard praised his 'world-class performance, swing, invention and stunning instrumental technique.' He has a rich, powerful sound enabling him to steam through up-tempo numbers and channel tenderness through quieter ones. His new quartet features Ross Stanley on piano, the great Mick Hutton on bass and Chris Higginbottom on drums, a regular in the Ronnie Scott's All-Stars.

<description><![CDATA[Ivan Cooper will be reading extracts from his book and will describe how his adventures in the remote grasslands of eastern Tibet gave him an entree into ways of life and thought fundamentally different from our own and the challenges this entailed.

Alone and isolated in a land where few foreigners have set foot he is forced to re-evaluate both who he is and the fixed certainties of the culture in which he grew up. Participation in a sky burial, the traditional form of Tibetan funeral - corpses are disembowelled by specialist monks before being fed to the vultures - shocks him into a profound affirmation of his own identity.

After the reading Ivan will answer questions from the audience and share some photographs.

<event_title><![CDATA[Rob Newman's New Theory Of Evolution]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA['He is the funniest comedian I have ever seen...A passionate, chaotically brilliant comedian.' THE SUNDAY TIMES

Comedian, journalist, novelist and activist Rob Newman makes a hotly anticipated return to comedy with his first complete show in 7 years.

'I am completely in awe of Robert Newman. Of his talent, his passion, his intelligence, and the way he turns them to comedy with real firepower. If this world could be saved by a Superhero whose Superpower was Comedy, that hero would be Robert Newman. KATE COPSTICK, THE SCOTSMAN

Rob describes the 150-year controversy in evolutionary theory and explores how the latest science demonstrates that DNA is not destiny.  From a Devil's Orchard made by lemon ants, to female buffalo voting which way to go, from Prince Kropotkin escaping a Tsarist dungeon to altruistic vampire bats and Richard Dawkins' postman wrestling naked, Rob Newman argues that cooperation drives evolution more than competition.

Rob said: "Natural history is so full of freaky facts that when you tackle the complexity, you find that there is a wealth of detail, oodles of oddity which lend themselves to comedy."

In the past 20 years Rob has performed five solo stand-up shows including From "Caliban to The Taliban (500 years of Humanitarian Intervention)" in (2003) and "Apocalypso Now" (2005) which was recorded and aired by More4 under the title A History of Oil. He has also written regularly for The Guardian and Vice magazine, and produced four novels, his most recent being The Trade Secret which is due to be released in April 2013, published by Cargo/Cargo Crate. His TV and radio credits include Robert Newman's History of Oil (More4), History of the World Backwards (BBC Four), Newman & Baddiel In Pieces (BBC Two) and The Mary Whitehouse Experience (BBC Two).

<description><![CDATA[Since they formed in Leeds in 1999 The New Mastersounds have spread their wings and earned themselves a healthy following across the Pond but they tend to return once a year to play in their home town. This time they're back to launch a new album, "Therapy" (their ninth studio record!)

"The New Mastersounds, from the Yorkshire city of Leeds, are part of a vast British network tied together through their love of classic American R&B, funk and souljazz. What sets The New Mastersounds apart is their expertise: the keyboard-driven collective comes on like a juiced-up, highly kinetic New Orleans version of Booker T & the MGs and their jazzy style has earned them praise from their idols - Maceo Parker, The Neville Brothers, the JBs and The Meters among others."

<event_title><![CDATA[Lucy Ward Band, With Atlum Schema]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Making her third appearance at Live At All Hallows, but her first with a full band, is Derby songstress Lucy Ward.

Performing both self-penned and traditional material, she won the Horizon Award at the 2012 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. Lucy's sophomore album "Single Flame" is LAAH founder Steve Thackray's album of 2013, and has garnered rave reviews, but it's her live performances that have made her one of the hottest acts in Britfolk, and why we're very excited to have her playing for us once more.

http://www.lucywardsings.com/

For her April 14 tour she has recruited a stellar collection of musicians for her band: O'Hooley and Tidow, Joy Gravestock (Orchestral fiddler), Sam Pegg (bassist) & Steve Maclachlan from The Willows on percussion.

Support comes from Atlum Schema: aka Andy Mort. Described as "electro-political folk" by the Guardian, Andy's another Live At All Hallows team favourite. His new album Year 0 is out in March 14, about which he says "Year 0 came together over just two weeks in the summer of 2013. It confronts themes of loss, the frailty of the human body, the potential strength of human spirit and the absurd attention and importance we collectively give to futile things. Initially intended as a stripped back, acoustic record, it grew through the recording process into an ambient spirited, reflective, electronic exploration of the human condition. It is about discovering in the past the inescapable clues to the mysteries of the future, and the idea that every moment that passes by is another opportunity to weave something new."

'Compelling, emotionally resonant, genrefree music... maybe Frisell deserves his own genre. How about 'friz'?' Financial Times

With 25 seminal albums and over 200 recordings, guitarist, composer, and bandleader Bill Frisell has firmly established himself as a visionary presence in American music. His trio plays music from his Beautiful Dreamers album, which traverses a broad terrain of American music, ranging from the visceral blues of Blind Willie Johnson's 'Nobody's Fault' to the iconic title track.

His trio is completed by viola player Eyvind Kang and Rudy Royston on drums, and together they create a sound characterised by its intimacy, quiet joy and constant sense of discovery.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[If you had unprecedented access to classified networks 14 hours a day, 7 days a week for 8+ months, what would you do?

In 2010 Pfc Bradley Manning, a US Army intelligence analyst, leaked classified documents to WikiLeaks. In 2013, he was sentenced to 35 years in jail for this crime. In 2013, Bradley Manning became Chelsea Manning. How did this 26 year old super-intelligent, awkwardly effeminate soldier become the centrepiece in the war between WikiLeaks and the US Government? And what now for Manning?

DESERT explores the extraordinary true story of this little-known but hugely significant figure, blending real-life transcripts with imagined events. Responding to events as they happen, the MolinoGroup's "excellent new play" (Exeunt) captures the force of this compelling, contemporary narrative.]]></description>

Liszt  Prelude (Fantasia) & Fugue on 'B.A.C.H'

Bach  Concerto I in G, S592

Franck  Prelude, Fugue et Variation

Howells  Rhapsody I in D flat, Op 17

Guilmant  Sonata I in D minor, Op 42: Final

Winner of the 2013 Organ Prize at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester, David Hardie is also Organist and Director of Music at St Peter's Hale and Conductor of the Chester St Cecilia Singers. David's programme of organ classics includes Bach's Concerto in G, arranged from an orchestral original now believed to be by Prince Johann Ernst but attributed previously to Antonio Vivaldi, Franck's hauntingly beautiful Prelude, Fugue et Variationand the first of Howells's four Rhapsodies for organ. The concert ends with the finale from Guilmant's First Sonata in D and unfolds from the dramatic outpouring of Liszt's Prelude and Fugue on "B.A.C.H." - the four-note motto theme of which is derived from two pairs of descending semi-tones each provided by the German musical nomenclature of the four letters of Bach's surname - B (B flat), A, C, and H (B natural).

<description><![CDATA[plus guest support... Broken DC.

On True Widow's highly anticipated third album 'Circumambulation', the Dallas heavy 'stonegaze' trio hone in on their trademark syrupy simplicity with absolute perfection. Equal parts drone, post-rock and shoegaze, 'Circumambaulation' is the band's most, controlled, concise and realized effort yet. Simultaneously True Widow's darkest and poppiest record, 'Circumambaulation' is a moody triumph of a record perfect for both super late nights, and early Sunday mornings. Rarely does a band capture the vibe of dreary haze together with sticky male/female harmonies so infectiously.

True Widow's 'Circumambulation' is an easy top contender for record of summer, if not all of 2013.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Shaking hands with Satan

'Mantel... instinctively grabs for the reachably real' The New Yorker

From rumours that Anne Boleyn sold her soul for her crown to the Faustian pacts of the technology age, Hilary Mantel investigates the history of the human relationship with the devil.

The double Man Booker Prize-winning author (Wolf Hall, Bring up the Bodies) says that whilst growing up, the devil was a vital presence in her own life and so it was only natural that he should feature in her novels. In this specially commissioned talk, she traces the footsteps of the devil in her life, her fiction and in today's world.

This talk has been rescheduled from Autumn 2012 and includes live music from violinist David le Page.

<event_title><![CDATA[An August Bank Holiday Lark]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[It's an idyllic summer in 1914 rural Lancashire. Excitement is building for Wakes week; a rest from field and mill and a celebration of the Rushbearing Festival with singing, courting, drinking and dancing.

The looming war barely registers ... but it will.

An August Bank Holiday Larkis a gentle, deeply moving drama poised at the tipping point of war.  Intensely nostalgic and emotionally rich, this is a story that will both entertain and tug at your heart strings.



Through the lens of traditional rural life you'll follow the stories of folk with colour, character and charm, and witness their personal transitions from exuberance and touching naivety to a profound and devastating loss of innocence.

Performed by the charismatic cast of actor-musicians that is Northern Broadsides

 "A must-see event."

Muriel Cellier was born in Lyon, France. She started playing the violin at the age of four, but changed to the cello after hearing the Beaux Arts Trio performing Schubert in concert. Muriel Cellier studied with Xavier Gagnepain, Patrick Gabard in France and Stefan Popov in London where she obtained a Master Degree in Performance from the Guildhall School of Music. She has played internationally with many orchestras and as a solo player and chamber musician has performed with dancers, visual and theatrical artists. Her quest for unconventional performance situations and contact with young audiences was one of the reasons that initiated her collaboration with the pianist David Strong.
Born in Yorkshire David studied piano at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester under Marjorie Clementi, and later with Bernard Roberts. In 1990 he moved to Denmark where he won the position of pianist in the Jutland Ensemble, a chamber group employed by the Danish government.

<description><![CDATA[Presented by Oliver Bray.

It's a nursery where we force cylinders into square holes and cubes into round ones while our parents and proctors aren't looking. Does it work? Depends on the day.
- Francois Caradec

Scaff' struggles to come to terms with his life, he is preoccupied, distracted and perpetually in a state of astonishment...his task is made more difficult by the fact that there are three of everything, including him.

This new work by Oliver Bray is inspired by the literary constraints of the French writing group OuLiPo (Ouvroir de Litterature Potentielle, or Workshop of Potential Literature).  The performance has been generated through the indiscriminate and unapologetic application of constraint after constraint after constraint after constraint.....etc.

Leeds City Varieties is delighted to announce An Evening With David Sedaris will take place on Thursday 10 April 2014. After three sell-out runs in London and two sell-out Edinburgh Fringe Festival stints Sedaris will embark on his first ever UK tour in March and April of 2014 and we're delighted to announce he's coming to Leeds for what is sure to be a very popular night and one of the literary events of the year in the city.

"David Sedaris isn't a stand-up, or even much of a showman.  But in his own dry and unassuming way, he's one of the finest comic talents currently living on this planet." THE GUARDIAN

"He has a Bennett-like way with a pause, and pitch perfect comedy timing..." SCOTSMAN

"Profanity seldom sounds this refined, phrases so expertly massaged, or laughs so lovingly engineered."  THE HERALD

"No, Sedaris isn't a stand-up, but he's certainly a masterful comic writer, whose modest delivery brings his words to hilarious life."  CHORTLE]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Jesca Hoop]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Jesca Hoop has lived all over the map, and her rich life experience is reflected in her distinctive voice and natural gift for inventive song craft.

Hoop learned to sing at an early age, harmonising with her musical Mormon family in northern California. She began writing highly idiosyncratic songs at the age of 14 to keep her company on her long walks to school. At 16, Hoop broke away from her strict upbringing and began what she calls her 'life as a racoon', off the grid & close to nature. Rambling through the high mountain deserts of the Southwest and along the coastlines of the Northwest, she worked as a wilderness survival guide and chalked up skills in farming, surveying, and carpentry. Her songwriting continued throughout, shared on porches, in deep river canyons and around campfires.

In 2004 the desire to share these songs on a broader scale set in. She settled in Los Angeles, where she honed her songwriting craft and developed a reputation as a unique and beguiling live performer of real substance. Though she now resides in Manchester, England, Hoop returned to Los Angeles to record her third album, The House That Jack Built.

Jesca has quite the growing collection of fans in high places: Tom Waits described her music as being "like a four sided coin. She is an old soul, like a black pearl, a good witch or red moon. Her music is like going swimming in a lake at night". Peter Gabriel took her to South America to sing with him, and in recent years she has been hand picked to play as support on tour for Eels, Andrew Bird, Punch Brothers and Elbow: Elbow's Guy Garvey even had her do a stint as guest presenter on his BBC radio show in early 2012, to great reception.]]></description>

'Spellbinding' The Sunday Telegraph

The Roges are dedicated ambassadors for French music. They have played across the world, sharing their love of Debussy, Ravel and the other great Gallic pioneers, and they continue to arrange French orchestral music for the special possibilities of four hands.

As Opera North prepares to open La Boheme, a vision of Paris dreamed by an Italian, this is the perfect moment to immerse ourselves in the music of the great French Impressionist composers.

The Roge's stunning rendition will include Ravel's Rhapsodie Espagnole and Sonatine, while Debussy's La Mer concludes our French evening.]]></description>

Great homes for fishes
Others, if you're lucky,
Will grant your wishes
But down this one you'll find
(if you're brave enough to go)
A wonderful, magical, world below.

Written especially for children aged 3-7 and told with their own captivating blend of energetic storytelling, hand-crafted puppets, enchanting scenery and original music, Isabel's Well is a journey into a child's imagination where anything is possible!]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Cud Playing... 'When In Rome, Kill Me']]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Emerging from the same art/design cauldron that produced fellow Leeds legends Soft Cell, Scritti Politti, and The Mekons, CUD were the pre-Britpop answer to doleful shoegazing bands - fun-loving, light-hearted, romantic and downright catchy.

Alternatively loved or loathed like a yeast extract, CUD are indie rock for the unpretentious pleasure seeker, boasting as they do the rich deep-lunged voice of Carl Puttnam, edgy guitars of Mike Dunphy and tight, funky rhythm section of William Potter, bass and Gogs Byrn, drums.

CUD were initially lauded for their quirky Peel session cover of 'You Sexy Thing' in 1987. They soon built up a huge live following and buffed up their repertoire with a string of unstraight pop beauties, best exemplified by the 1990 album 'Leggy Mambo'. This led to a major-label deal with A&M in 1991, front-page NME coverage, massive sellout gigs and proper Top 30 hits, 'Rich and Strange' and 'Purple Love Balloon'.

Misunderstood by record companies and press, CUD packed away their guitars and sticks in 1995 but, bolstered by a greatest hits anthology ('Rich and Strange') in 2006, they agreed to tread the boards again and found an army of 'Space CUDets' still eager to sing along, dance like fruitcakes and invade their stage.

In 2012, CUD reunited with their original guitarist and key songwriter, Mike Dunphy, and the result is their first new material in 18 years, the perky 7" and download single 'Louise' b/w 'Mexico'.

To top this, CUD are playing two of their most popular albums in their entirety over two spring nights in Leeds.]]></description>

Sam Amidon has been recording for a decade and playing music for twenty years before that. Raised in Vermont he has collaborated with Beth Orton, toured with New York pianist Thomas Barlett (aka Doveman) and embarked on a series of live shows with guitarist Bill Frisell.

His album Bright Sunny South, which he describes as a 'lonesome record', is packed with classic folk songs, country ballads and shape-note hymns. A fearless singer and multi-instrumentalist, he also takes on pop hits, challenging what folk can be. First heard at the Howard Assembly Room supporting Nina Nastasia in 2011, we are delighted to welcome him back with his own show.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Life can sometimes feel far too hectic! (Who are we kidding?! - it feels like that most of the time!).... Why not escape for a few hours and take some time for you...

Slow Art Day is a global event with a simple mission: to encourage people to look at art SLOWLY and to help more people discover for themselves the joy of looking at and loving art.

Back this year by popular demand The Stanley & Audrey Burton Gallery will be downing tools and taking time to simply look. Join us as we look at 5 pre-assigned pieces of art at leisure and then break for tea and cake and an informal discussion about what everyone's discovered.

Feel free to bring your own snacks!

The Stanley & Audrey Burton Gallery is the only Slow Art Day venue in Leeds this year. Don't miss it!]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[The Great Flood]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[American Routes

'one of the highlights of the 2012 London jazz festival' The Guardian

In the spring of 1927, the Mississippi river broke its banks in 145 places and inundated 27,000 square miles to a depth of up to 30 feet. One of the most destructive floods in history, part of its enduring legacy was the mass exodus of displaced sharecroppers. Musically, the 'Great Migration' of rural southern blacks to northern cities saw the Delta Blues electrified and reinterpreted as the Chicago Blues, Rhythm and Blues, and Soul.

Using minimal text and no spoken dialogue, filmmaker Bill Morrison and composer / guitarist Bill Frisell create a powerful portrait of a seminal moment in American history, through a collection of silent images matched to a searing original soundtrack.

Soundtrack by Bill Frisell. Please note the soundtrack is recorded.

Dir Bill Morrison; 2011; 80mins, USA]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[TAKING CHARLIE is a dark comedic fantasy, based on a true story, about the abduction of Charlie Chaplin's body by two hapless kidnappers in 1978. A tale full of comedy, bad ideas and dead comics that uses puppetry, physical theatre and shadow play to create its inventive and farcical world.

<description><![CDATA[THE GO!GO!GO! SHOW is an all-new family pop musical experience featuring five fantastic new stars of stage, screen and pop. There are brand new pop songs, catchy, easy-to-learn dance moves, plenty of audience interaction and loads of laughs. Gemma, Carl, Jade, Steve and Holly are joined by the permanently confused Mr. Baffled and his trusty sidekick, the Fluffalope (who lives entirely on a diet of socks!).

They all live on the islands of Baffadopolis in an old lighthouse near Holiday Bay. They love exploring and they like to help to solve the problems that Mr. Baffled tells them about... or creates himself! Most of all they love singing and dancing and they have a song for pretty much any occasion, whether it's WAKE UP SMILING in the mornings, HEY THERE SLEEPY HEAD for night time or CHOICES for lunch! You can catch them singing and dancing here on Nick Jr. and on tour at Leeds City Varieties in April.

Come on! What are you waiting for? READY? STEADY? GO!GO!GO!

Go!Go!Go!

<description><![CDATA[Following on from the release of their brand new album That's What Happens on Warner Brothers Records and their headlining performance at The Royal Variety Show 2013, Chas & Dave will be appearing at Leeds Grand Theatre next year.

 Chas & Dave began writing and performing songs together in 1972, having been friends since the early sixties. They are now celebrating their 50th Anniversary by recording their first original album in 27 years - a mixture of vintage rock & roll songs and new renditions of their own rockney classics. The album also features special guest stars such as Jools Holland and Hugh Laurie.

They reached the top twenty in 1979 with Gertcha, which became a nationwide catchphrase. This was followed by Rabbit, which reached No. 8 in the charts, and a No. 2 record Ain't No Pleasing You in 1982. In 1986 they had a top six record with Snooker Loopy.

They have also written title songs for TV shows Till Death Do Us Part and Only Fools & Horses.]]></description>

For the final concert of the season, City Organist Simon Lindley is once again joined by the Boy Choristers, Choral Scholars and Lay Clerks of the Choir of Leeds Minster featuring solo artists Christopher Trenholme and Quentin Brown in William Lloyd Webber's magnificent, yet very rarely heard, Passiontide Cantata The Saviour. This year's performance provides a specialcentenary commemoration of William Lloyd-Webber who was born in London on 11 March 2014.There are hymns for all to sing very much in the traditionof Stainer's Crucifixion though the musical style is vastly different. Not for nothing is Lloyd Webber (father of Andrew and Julian) known as the English Rachmaninov.

<description><![CDATA[2014 marks the 21st year this group of musical friends have taken to the road to entertain their growing legion of fans with a show of huge dynamic range, passionate and joyful playing and a liberal dose of fun. What started as a daft idea for a folk club night has grown into a folk-rock institution with six CDs to their name, several festival appearances and sell out shows up and down the UK.

Fiddlers Peter Knight (Steeleye Span), Chris Leslie (Fairport Convention), Phil Beer (Show of Hands), Brian McNeill (Battlefield Band), Ian Cutler (Bully Wee), Tom Leary (Zeus) and Garry Blakeley (Band of Two) add the large range of fiddle playing styles to the rock back-line of guitars, keyboards, sax and accordion - all held together by legendary drummer Dave Mattacks. It's a feast by nature and a feast by name which is guaranteed to be enjoyed even by the most doubting of friends dragged along! Be prepared for laughter, tears, dancing and an all round evening of fabulously entertaining live music guaranteed!

"Feast of Fiddles cranked up the tempo over the last two numbers and worked the audience into a frenzy, resulting in vigorous clapping and stomping of feet" - Mark Salter, Lowdham Press

"Absolutely awesome!" - Sue Marchant, BBC East
"The best fiddle players of a generation" - fRoots

<event_title><![CDATA[Mike Watt & The Missingmen]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Mike Watt is the legendary singer-songwriter and bass guitarist, best-known for co-founding the seminal punk rock bands Minutemen and fIREHOSE; as of 2003, he is also the bassist for the reunited Iggy Pop & The Stooges, and a member of the art rock/jazz/punk/improv group Banyan, the bass guitar duo Dos and the magnificent Il Sogno del Mariano.

Watt is often cited as a key figure in the development of American alternative rock; The Red Hot Chili Peppers dedicated their hugely successful Blood Sugar Sex Magik to Watt. Throughout his career he has been known for his inventive, melodic playing; and thoroughly distinctive basslines.

Watt is a cultural omnivore. Especially over the last decade, his openness (and eagerness) to devour new musical experience has become increasingly audible (and visible) in the dozens of projects and live performances he's participated in with artists as divergent as Yoko Ono, Black Moth Super Rainbow, Petra Haden, Kelly Clarkson, Thurston Moore, Porno For Pyros, Nels Cline, Stephen Hodges (Tom Waits), J Mascis, Tony Maimone (Pere Ubu), Yuko Araki and Hirotaka 'Shimmy' Shimizu (Cornelius), Dougie Bowne (Lounge Lizards) and many more.

As always, Watt persists in exceeding, defying and confounding musical (and other) expectations: the truly romantic embodiment of an authentic punk rocker.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Northside followed the Hacienda heyday in 1991 with the release of their acclaimed UK Top 20 album 'Chicken Rhythms' on Factory Records. Despite being banned from daytime radio due to numerous drug references in their lyrics, the band still managed to recruit a large and loyal following.

Influenced by reggae, punk, and psychedelia, the band were invited to open the first night of the Great British Music Weekend in January 1991 at Wembley Arena, broadcast live over three nights on Radio One. Despite pleas from the station not to play their first single, Shall We Take A Trip? the band started with this number, causing the station to stop its live broadcast for several minutes. Opening for The Happy Mondays and The La's at Elland Road in Leeds on 1st June 1991, they were named by many, including the music monthlies, as the highlight of the day.

Now back together again the four original members of Northside (Paul Walsh - Drums, Tim Walsh- Guitar, Cliff Ogier - Bass and Warren Dermody - Vocals/Lyrics) have big plans for next year! For the first time in nearly twenty years, the band are rehearsing for a UK tour, festivals and overseas dates in 2014.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[St. Peter's Singers' traditional Good Friday concert in the choir's thirty-fifth anniversary year will be a performance of J.S.Bach's monumental B minor Mass. The acclaimed Leeds based chamber choir presents the work - one of the supreme achievements in classical music - in Leeds Minster on Friday 18 April 2014 at 7.00 pm.

The Singers first presented Bach's masterpiece here at the Minster in 1985 as part of the celebrations of the Tercentenary of the great composer's birth, and has performed the work many times since, including, memorably at Leeds Town Hall in 1991 in celebration of the 150th anniversary of the consecration of Leeds Parish Church in 1841.

Kristina James - soprano
Helen Strange - soprano
Lucy Appleyard - mezzo soprano
Chris Trenholme - tenor
Quentin Brown - bass
David Houlder - organ

National Festival Orchestra
Sally Robinson - leader

Music Director of St Peter's Singers, Dr Simon Lindley, said:
'It can be said that no single musical work is greater than Bach's Mass in B minor; the glorious sonorities of the piece include wonderful settings of the sections of the Creed dealing with the suffering, death, burial and Resurrection of Jesus, making a performance on Good Friday an especially compelling experience.'

<description><![CDATA[Imagine Roky Erickson backed by the Sun Ra Arkestra or Wilson Pickett and The Velvet Underground, or picture the love child of Anubis and Kali. King Khan & The Shrines is more than a psychedelic soul band with a spectacle of a stage show. They are a cult musical phenomenon with more than 10 years of international touring, multiple studio records and a fan base of fervent punk, soul, free jazz and garage rock heads.

King Khan, the spiritual guru and front man, cobbled together a fierce line-up of musicians while in Berlin in between reading Tarot cards and raising a family. What he ended up with in 1999 is one of the most entertaining groups the world has seen and heard since the days of Ike & Tina. The line-up includes Chicago-born, Ron Streeter (veteran percussionist for Curtis Mayfield, Stevie Wonder), a horn section consisting of trumpeter Simon Wojan (member of Kranky Records recording artists Cloudland Canyon), tenor sax man Torben Wesche (Germany's John Coltrane), and famous French rockabilly baritone saxophonist Frederic Brissaud. The rhythm section of the Sensational Shrines has been called a German/French version of the Freak Brothers - Till Timm on guitar, organist Frederic Bourdil, Jens Redemann on bass and drummer Mirko Wenzl.]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[The Rezillos]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Plus guest support Spizzenergi.

The Rezillos burst forth upon the rock scene in 1976, having gathered together at Edinburgh College of Art. Through a shared love of Sixties Garage Rock and the Spectoresque Girl Group glam of The Ronettes and The Shangri-Las, The Rezillos found themselves inadvertently caught up in the Punk or New Wave movement. Their debut single, "I Can't Stand My Baby", shot them to underground fame initially via airings on John Peel's radio show. Their classic singles "My Baby Does Good Sculptures", "Top of the Pops" and "Destination Venus" signalled critically acclaimed milestones for the band.

Their landmark album of 1978 "Can't Stand the Rezillos" reached the top 10 in the UK album chart. They appeared twice on the legendary Old Grey Whistle Test and hit the Top Twenty with their hit single 'Top of the Pops', a satirical swipe at the UK pop music programme of the same name. Once the band had achieved chart success it was inevitable that they should appear on the same show! They followed up that same year with a live recording, "Mission Accomplished... But the Beat Goes On", and promptly broke up to the anguish of fans and music critics alike.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Eddi Reader was brought into the limelight with Fairground Attraction and their single Perfect and parent album First of a Million Kisses which both topped the British charts.  However, it has been her subsequent solo albums which signalled her increasing ability to assimilate different musical styles and make them all very much her own.  From the traditional to the contemporary, Eddi brings to joyous life all forms of song and what sets Reader apart is the depth and quality of the emotional performance;  her ability not only to move the listener but to connect her experience to that of her audience.  Her rare blend of meltingly true vocals and towering romanticism combine with an astute and pragmatic nature to make her a unique and powerful figure in contemporary British music.  She has effortlessly developed into one of popular music's most thrilling and affecting performers.

New Album Vagabond will be released on 3 February 2014, more info @ www.eddireader.co.uk.

<event_title><![CDATA[Billy Pearce - Funny Guy]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[National treasure, and without doubt one of Britain's most talented and best loved comedians, Billy Pearce emerged from the fertile talent fields of Butlins in the mid 1980's. Multi Award winner Billy, has won just about every comedy award going, including a British comedy award, Solo comedian of the year, and Best television comedy newcomer at the London Palladium.

Billy, who was born in Leeds, first came to National prominence when he appeared in Central TV's top talent show 'New Faces', winning his heat and qualifying for the final. His impact was immediate and he was quickly snapped up for stage and TV appearances, culminating with his first series for BBC television, 'You Gotta Be Joking'.

When variety fell out of fashion in the 1990s, with the rise of alternative comedy, Billy found a niche in family-friendly panto while keeping the razor-sharp wit needed to entertain adult-only audiences.

<description><![CDATA[Original German text based on Elisabeth Hauptmann's German Translation of John Gay's THE BEGGAR'S OPERA

Imagine a world where evil goes unpunished and lowly souls remain on the poverty line. London's most notorious criminal Macheath has recently married Polly the daughter of Jonathan Peachum, leader of the beggars. The New Wolsey Theatre's Peter Rowe and Graeae's Jenny Sealey have joined forces once again to bring you their anarchic version of Weill and Brecht's the Threepenny opera - adapted from John Gay's The Beggars Opera.

With well known songs such as Mack the Knife and live music played on stage by the actors themselves, expect a riotous musical comedy they'll be begging to see.

All performances include live audio description and a creative combination of BSL interpretation and captioning.]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Miss Nightingale]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[After taking the UK and West End by storm in 2013 the hit musical Miss Nightingale comes home to Yorkshire!

Northern songbird Maggie and her Jewish composer, George, are struggling to find their big break.  She longs for stardom and the high life.  He wants to bring a bit of his beloved Berlin to Blighty.

Everything changes when they are picked up by wealthy man about town Sir Frank Worthington-Blythe who needs an act to launch his new nightclub.  Maggie is transformed into Music Hall star 'Miss Nightingale' and her outrageous outfits, satirical songs and scandalous love life make her the toast of London.

But away from the showbiz glamour, heartache and secrets threaten to change their lives forever.

Miss Nightingale is a glorious show, where saucy humour spotlights a moving tale of love, loss and hope - when every day needs to be lived as your last, and the best you can do is stand up and be counted.  The original songs, from hilarious tongue-in-cheek numbers to tender ballads, perfectly capture the style and spirit of the Forties.

<description><![CDATA[Leeds Art Gallery's picture lending library was established in 1961 as a way for people to enjoy original art at home - come to the Gallery and choose high quality pictures from a large collection to borrow and take home.

Over six hundred art works are available to borrow from oils, drawings, photographs and a variety of prints; whether you like landscapes or abstracts, Henri Matisse or Henry Moore, there is something to suit every taste.

How much does it cost?
There is no membership or joining fee, you pay for what you borrow. It costs just &pound;4 per month for one artwork and then &pound;2 per month for any additional works. All artworks are for a minimum period of three months (therefore a min payment of &pound;12 is applicable).]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Torvill & Dean's Dancing On Ice Live]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[A spectacular live show.

The first celebrities to skate on Torvill & Dean's Dancing On Ice Live Tour have been announced. Ray Quinn, Hayley Tamaddon (pictured), Kyran Bracken and Joe Pasquale will be joining Jayne Torvill and Chris Dean on their skating spectacular, which comes to the first direct arena this April.

Jayne and Chris said: "This year will be the 30th anniversary of Bolero and our Olympic Gold medal in Sarajevo, so for us, it seems a fitting time to say goodbye to Dancing on Ice. We wanted to go out on a high! It will be the biggest and best tour we've done to date and there will be some great surprises for the audiences across the country - we hope you will come and see us."

Using the same format as the hit ITV1 show, spectators can use their mobile phones to text vote for their favourite celebrity. Audience votes will then be added to scores from the judges to decide the overall celebrity winner. The winning couple will then take to the ice for a magical finale performance. As with previous tours, all profits from text voting will go to charity.

Olympic gold medal winner Robin Cousins will head the panel of rink-side judges, alongside former professional skaters Karen Barber and Nicky Slater. They will be on hand to give their expert feedback and all important scores to the celebrities and their skating partners.]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Film With Live Score: Sunrise]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[A Song of Two Humans

With newly commissioned live soundtrack by Joanna MacGregor and Andy Sheppard.

'Inspirational, intense and deeply moving' The Arts Desk on Joanna MacGregor

Taking inspiration from the music of Tom Waits, Johnny Cash and traditional American spirituals, pianist Joanna MacGregor and jazz saxophonist Andy Sheppard create a new live score for Sunrise, F.W. Murnau's 1927 masterpiece of silent film, especially for the Howard Assembly Room.

Made in the twilight of the silent era, Sunrise became a swan-song for the vanishing medium and one of its greatest expressions, a story about innocence and experience, urban and rural America, about love and violence.

As part of an ongoing fascination with film and music, this Sunrise live soundtrack explores the effect that music has on film and vice-versa.

<description><![CDATA['The Brewis brothers are the anti-Gallaghers working class Northerners who challenge you with their sharp, bright, baroque pop'. - MOJO

The new School Of Language is called Old Fears and it's set for release on Memphis Industries on 7 April 2014.

Old Fears. It's a pop record. A place of clipped falsetto, melancholic funk, iridescent electro, shimmering post-punk, futurist prog. A self-contained sphere of strange sensations. Beguiling textures. Lengthening shadows. At times it is both liminal and minimal, at others emotive and external. Ambiguous and ambient. Tantalising and tempered. Modern. Unique. And funny too. "I wrote a lot of notes and they seemed to distinctly split into things to do with love and things to do with fear," says David Brewis. "A lot of it has ended up with me looking back at when I was 19, 20 - my formative years. So though I wouldn't want to call it a concept album it's definitely themed."]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Award-winning comedian Jo Caulfield is back with a hilarious new show. Jo's always wondered why anger is seen as such a bad thing. When life presents such irritations as vacuous celebrities, endless TV quiz shows, arrogant shop-assistants, emotionally 'challenged' men, drunken girlfriends who always pick the wrong partner, and a husband who continually quotes The Godfather, surely having a good rant - and a good laugh - is the only sensible reaction?  Enjoy your anger.

Star of many a tv and radio show, Jo is "feisty, funny and wonderfully bitchy" (Observer), with a "cut-throat wit and a razor-sharp tongue" (Times)  A fantastic night out, for men and women alike.]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[La Boheme]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[A revival of the 1993 production.

Phyllida Lloyd's famed production of La Boheme has been praised for its perennial freshness, immediacy and close attention to the text. It gives full expression to the joy, wit and frivolity of student life in Paris in the early 1960s, when it is set, but also faces squarely the devastation that death brings when it arrives in the midst of the lives of a group of young friends. Anthony Ward's detailed and atmospheric designs vividly convey the hustle and bustle of the clubs and cafes of Paris.

Boheme remains one of the most popular of operas, and rightly so. Puccini weaves a web of glorious melody throughout, and his music speaks directly to the heart of anyone who has ever been young, and loved and lost.

'Lloyd's Boheme remains unmatched ... its radicalism remains powerful and immediate, and you would still be hard-pressed to find a production of Puccini's masterpiece that offers quite so challenging and cogent an interpretation as this.' The Guardian, January 2010

<event_title><![CDATA[Thomas Houseago]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Leeds-born artist Thomas Houseago is today one of the most internationally influential sculptors of his generation.

The Yorkshire Sculpture Triangle, a partnership between four locally rooted world-class sculpture organisations (Henry Moore Institute, Leeds Art Gallery, The Hepworth Wakefield and the Yorkshire Sculpture Park) brings two of Thomas Haseago's sculptures to Yorkshire - a monumental new commission made specifically for Leeds city centre and one located at Yorkshire Sculpture Park.

The Los Angeles-based sculptor grew up in Leeds and is considered to be one of the most distinctive voices in contemporary art today. While his work has been shown globally, this is the first major commission in Yorkshire, a region that boasts a unique artistic legacy as the birthplace of Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore. Drawing on references ranging from Greek mythology, Darth Vader, Moore and Hepworth and the Incredible Hulk, Houseago's giant figures are concerned with volume, gravity and scale.

Outside Leeds Art Gallery stands a new sculpture by Houseago, made specifically for the occasion of the Yorkshire Festival 2014 and inspired by the city of Leeds. Caught in arrested motion, this gargantuan striding figure moves unrelentingly forward. Sited right on the Headrow, the sculpture alludes to the frenetic bustle of the surrounding urban landscape. With its rough finish, Houseago's figure contains the feeling of energy which the artist senses in the city. Within the grounds of Yorkshire Sculpture Park is another of Houseago's sculptures, an owl's head cast in bronze on a redwood plinth, reflecting the artist's interest in natural forms and forces and echoing the symbol of Leeds.

This ambitious project to bring Thomas Houseago back from the US to his birthplace in Yorkshire has been developed by the Yorkshire Sculpture Triangle and realised with the support of the 2014 Grand Depart Cultural Festival and Leeds and Wakefield City Councils.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Dr Virginia Campbell presents the final talk in the six-lecture "The Present and Future of Vesuvian Research" research seminar series, focusing on social networks in Pompeii.

The talk will be in lecture theatre 3 (LT3) of the Clthworkers' Building, entrance opposite the Students Union.

Dr. Campbell holds a Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship for her project 'Social Network Analysis in Pompeii.' Her work on the tombs of Pompeii led to an interest in the epigraphic evidence from Pompeii and how this can be examined to explore the connectedness of the community. One of her recent publications, 'Menedemerumenus: tracing the routes of Pompeian graffiti writers,' Tyche (2012), demonstrates one way the graffiti can be used to study networks in an ancient city. Her blog further documents her initial work on this project.

The talk will be available online as a vodcast after the event through Virginia's Pompeian Connections blog.]]></description>

Waiting for Godot exploded on to stage over 50 years ago and revolutionised theatre. Shocking as many people as it amused and impressed, there had never been a play like it. Two men, joke, argue and repeat themselves, as they wait. Combining music hall, poetry and tension, it redefines what is possible in theatre. It is now accepted as one of the most significant plays of the 20th century. ]]></description>

Formed in Osaka 33 years ago the trio rose from humble DIY beginnings to joining Nirvana on their 'Nevermind' tour and trailblazing a path for women in music and inspiring legions of bands. Favourites of Kurt Cobain, John Peel, Thurston Moore, Marc Riley, Gideon Coe, Radcliffe & Maconie, Jonathon Ross & Dan Hegarty the band are arguably the most influential and beloved Japanese rock export.

Live, they are a tight rock machine punching out fast, highly exciting sets of Punk, Pop, Rock & Metal hits coated with a unique life affirming quirky magic that as they fast approach their 1000th gig, shows no signs of fading. As Naoko says 'Let's Rock!'

"When I finally got to see them live, I was transformed into a hysterical nine-year-old girl at a Beatles concert."Kurt Cobain

Selected Press -

Uncut: "rocks like Motorhead designed by Hanna-Barbara"

BBC Music: "The Osaka Ramones, you must concede, still have it."

The Independent: 8/10 "There are two types of people: those who enjoy thrashy Japanese girl-punk, and those who have something wrong with them."

Music OMH: 8/10 "For an incredible 31 years Shonen Knife have been pumping out prototype riot grrrl, thrashing together early punk sounds with pop melodies."

The Sunday Times: "irrepressible slice of bounce-along indie-pop. Beguiling."

Stewart Lee BBC 6Music (Steve Lamacq): "Shonen Knife - they know how to rock - Japanese punk pop at its best."]]></description>

"Intelligent, passionate and angry comedy" Evening Standard

Rich Hall's critically acclaimed grouchy, deadpan style has established him as a master of absurdist irony and the king of rapid-fire wit. The award-winning Montana native renowned for  his expertly crafted tirades and quick fire banter with audiences and delightful musical sequences saddles up and hitches his wagon to tour the British Isles once again. This is a comedian who's plain spoken growling indignation and acerbic observations have an unerring talent for hitting his targets with precision every time,  leaving his audience hanging on every word winning him fans all over the globe.  Perrier (Edinburgh Comedy Festival) Award and Barry (Melbourne International Comedy Festival) Award winner Hall has been described as a transatlantic messenger lampooning each country he visits with his common sense, and he is no less harsh to his homeland.

Rich has also become well known for his television and radio work. Notable UK appearances include regular appearances on Stand Up For The Week, Q I, Live At The Apollo, Channel 4's Comedy Gala Live At The O2, Have I Got News For You), Rich Hall's Cattle Drive, Rich Hall's Gone Fishing, Otis Lee Crenshaw - London Not Tennessee and Never Mind The Buzzcocks.

<event_title><![CDATA[Â¡Forward Russia!]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[This years exciting addition of the Leeds Town Hall as a new venue for Live At Leeds brings with it one of the finest home grown lineups going! In a city full of musical heritage, few buildings hold as much cultural gravitas as the Town Hall. Built between 1853 and 1858 and opened by Queen Victoria, the beautiful structure has been a hub for music, film and education for many years making it a true cultural mainstay of the city.

 The inimitable AÂ¡Forward, Russia! will be reforming to headline proceedings and bring with them their famed and oh too missed angular, jarring post-punk. Having last performed as a one-off to celebrate the 100th birthday of the legendary Leeds Brudenell Social Club at the tail end of last year they're a true part of the city's music scene and a more than welcome addition to this year's Live At Leeds lineup.

"After playing the 100 year anniversary at the Brudenell last year there was really no intention to do anything else. We never played Live At Leeds the first time around, but the opportunity to headline such a great venue with great friends was too good to turn down. We played with Trains loads and I played live with Sam." - Whiskas, AÂ¡Forward, Russia!

Joining them will be Leeds locals I Like Trains. The brooding post rock quartet recently celebrated ten years as a band and continue to captivate audiences with their fascinating and brilliantly original music. Having joined headliners AÂ¡Forward Russia! in celebrating the Brudenell's centenary by performing and re-releasing their debut EP Progress/Reform, the band know Leeds better than most and their historically rooted songs are a perfect match for both the venue and the festival.]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[The Bacchae ]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA["He is life's liberating force.
He is release of limbs and communion through dance.
He is laughter, and music in flutes.
He is repose from all cares - he is sleep!
When his blood bursts from the grape and flows across tables laid in his honour to fuse with our blood, he gently, gradually, wraps us in shadows of ivy-cool sleep."
- Euripides, The Bacchae

This new PCI Production work with songs is a contemporary adaptation of Euripides' quintessential Greek tragedy. Dionysus, the god of wine and theatre, takes terrible revenge on a city for defying his will, and leads his followers in rebellion against its authoritarian, patriarchal rule. Dionysus brings revolution and freedom - but also blurs the lines between pleasure, intoxication, madness and violence as the social order crumbles.

This adaptation reimagines the chorus of the Bacchae as the centre of this universal story about human obsessions and the pursuit of ecstasy to its gruesome and devastating conclusion.

"In The Bacchae, we are asked to recognise not just the smiling and dangerous Dionysus as a new divinity, but also to struggle to understand that the way we define ourselves and our social order is limited and fragile."
- Simon Goldhill)

<event_title><![CDATA[Plumhall Live At All Hallows, With Jonny Walker]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Plumhall have been with Live At All Hallows since the event's birth.... but only now have their first album due out, Thundercloud, and to celebrate they are touring throughout 2014

http://www.plumhall.co.uk/

Michell Plum (Waking The Witch, Chumbawamba) and Nick Hall (The Hall Brothers) "draw inspiration from very eclectic sources including Nick Lowe, Scott Walker, Ian McNabb, Guy Clark, Kate Bush, Aimee Mann, Everly Brothers, Johnny Cash & June Carter, Chumbawamba and Show of Hands - and they bring all these influences into a sound that is clearly their own, based on powerfully-played acoustic instruments, perfect harmonies and meaningful songs." (bio)

Whatever the analysis, they're fantastic live, so we jumped at the chance of a show on the album tour. Title track Thundercloud can be heard and downloaded on Bandcamp.

Support comes from Jonny Walker, who has been on the LAAH "to book list" since Mike attended one of his Citizens' Kazoo Orchestra protests in Camden last autumn. A professional busker who has only relatively recently started playing traditional gigs whilst continuing to perform on the streets across the UK and Europe, his 2012 debut EP 'This Is Not Me' was described as "Heartfelt, unpretentious and utterly charming" by Rocksucker and Jonny himself has been called mix of Dylan, Neil Young and the enigmatic Leonard Cohen. He is a natural storyteller with lyrics that challenge the depths.

http://www.jonnywalker.co.uk/

Alongside performing Jonny is an activist, founding grassroots advocacy body ASAP! (Association of Street Artists and Performers) and has been featured on BBC and ITV news, The Guardian and extensive local publications, for his ongoing campaign to overturn local and national government policies that place arbitrary restrictions on street music and damage the cultural lives of our towns and cities. He is the Founding Director of the Keep Streets Live Campaign for public spaces that are open to grassroots music and art. In Liverpool, York and Camden he has led public opposition to council policies that stifle street culture. The Live At All Hallows team are pleased to be able to do our bit to help support this important campaign.

Bangerz also debuted at #1 on both the Billboard Top 200 Album chart and the Digital Album Charts. Additionally, during release week, Bangerz hit #1 on iTunes in over 70 countries. Both singles, "Wrecking Ball" and "We Can't Stop", off Bangerz have already sold over 8 million copies worldwide.

Miley's music video for "Wrecking Ball" became the fastest music video ever to reach CERTIFIED status, VEVO's milestone for videos delivering 100 million views in only 6 days.

Cyrus shattered the previous record which she held for "We Can't Stop," which was CERTIFIED by VEVO just 37 days after it premiered.

Bangerz has been getting rave reviews including Entertainment Weekly calling it "...utterly fresh, a pop blitz from a hip-hop blueprint, and proof that Miley won't settle for just shocking us." US Weekly declared it "the year's most titillating pop explosion" awarding the album "4 stars (out of 4)."

The story of how The Blues Band formed in 1979 to play the music that was their passion, just for fun and a bit of beer money, and then found themselves with whole new careers on their hands, has been well documented in countless magazine articles and record company biographies.

In the past 35 years the band have played all around the world in venues ranging from intimate clubs through to civic halls and theatres, and have wowed festival audiences in many countries - including headline appearances at Glastonbury.

The band's passion and reverence for the music, their presentation and showmanship all combine to deliver the definitive good night out.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Inspired by innovators from John Cage to Aphex Twin, Hauschka aka Volker Bertelmann is known for compelling live performances that re-imagine the possibilities of the piano by carrying out an array of imaginative 'preparations to reveal its internal mechanisms.

Recorded in a ten day burst of creative energy following the birth of his first son, his newly released album Abandoned City evokes the ghostly romance of the ruin via his trademark piano preparations and - for the first time -electronic processing. An array of delays, reverbs and pitch-shifting effects bend to his will to create a shimmering world of layers that emanate from the piano.

"Satie feather-drops, gorgeous string plucks, transfixing rattles. Stillness is the move." Rolling Stone

"The sounds that Volker Bertelmann creates with(in) a piano are nothing short of astonishing... a triumph" Mojo ****

<description><![CDATA[Barrence Whitfield is a full-throttle soul screamer in the spirit of Little Richard, Wilson Pickett, and Solomon Burke. He has been described as the owner of one incredible pair of lungs, with limitless energy and unmatched enthusiasm for his music and his audience. Barrence is a rarity in this business-one of a few black, rock 'n roll singer/entertainers who Spin Magazine says maintains a frenzied performance. The Savages lay down a groovy racket that's so thick and greasy, you'll need to keep moist towelettes near the hi-fi. Barrence and the boys are to soul what the Cramps are to Rockabilly-a gateway musical drug to America's demented roots underbelly. Whitfield is a performer so consumed with satisfying his audiences that he has been called 'crazed, frenetic and completely unhinged.']]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Evita]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Telling the story of Eva Peron, wife of former Argentine dictator Juan Peron, EVITA follows Eva's journey from humble beginnings through to extraordinary wealth, power and iconic status which ultimately led her to be heralded as the 'spiritual leader of the nation' by the Argentine people. With more than 20 major awards to its credit, including the Oscar winning film version starring Madonna and Antonio Banderas, Evita features some of the most iconic songs in musical theatre, including Don't Cry For Me Argentina, On This Night of a Thousand Stars, You Must Love Me, and Another Suitcase in Another Hall.

Marti Pellow plays Che, a character who reflects the voice of the Argentine people; linked to Eva by destiny he brings conflict to the story of Eva's rise to fame.

As a solo-singer, recording artist, and at the beginning of his career with Wet Wet Wet, Marti Pellow has enjoyed virtually un-rivalled chart success, with over 25 hits and three of the UK's biggest number one singles, including the seminal Love Is All Around. He has performed all over the world, and his West End and Musical Theatre appearances include The Witches of Eastwick, Chess, Jekyll & Hyde, Chicago and Blood Brothers. He rejoins the cast of EVITA fresh from an arena tour with Wet Wet Wet.

This production introduces a new star, Madalena Alberto, bringing the role of Eva to life to incredible critical acclaim. Madalena's musical theatre credits include the role of Piaf at the Curve Theatre, Leicester, Fantine in the 25th Anniversary production of Les Miserables. Other roles include Lucy in Jekyll and Hyde (Union Theatre, London), Carmen Diaz in Fame (UK Tour), Sam in Over the Threshold (Edinburgh and London) and Sonia in Godspell (Union Theatre, London). The Portuguese singer-songwriter also released her album Heart Condition in 2012.

<event_title><![CDATA[For Their Own Good ]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Presented By United Artists

Can the way we kill animals tell us anything about how we deal with our own demise? With unflinching honesty and an eerily detached workmanship, two knackermen investigate the pitfalls of being high up the evolutionary chain.

Combining puppetry, new writing and documentary material, Fringe First 2013 award winner, For Their Own Good tells a moving and darkly comic tale about the only certainty in life: death and how it's become removed from us as a process.

Could I also add that the performance would be preceded by an event entitled 'On Death and Dying: Human-Animal Encounters' which will include a round table with specialists on end-of-life treatment and representatives from the meat production industry.

<event_title><![CDATA[The Ghost Peloton]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[A Ghost Peloton of cyclists, drawing on the spirit of the Tour de France but forsaking dreams of heroism, commits to mass communal movement juxtaposed with complex and extraordinarily athletic choreography inspired by the wheel in motion and performed on film by Phoenix's dancers.

Each ghost rider, bike and dancer wears a bespoke LED light suit that changes colour, flash-rate and luminosity as the Peloton changes course. The combined results produce mesmerising light patterns as the cyclists interact with their passing surroundings, culminating in a public performance and film projection as night falls in central Leeds.

Both as large-scale public art and through the powerful film and photography it will inspire, the work allows us to see the body in perfect motion and to look again at familiar environments. The landscape of Yorkshire from remote moor to urban heartland becomes an open canvas carrying a new visual language seen in live performance and a documentary film by renowned cycling film director Mark Huskisson.

Ghost Peloton builds on the worldwide success of NVA's Speed of Light which since 2012 has choreographed massed endurance runners in sites as diverse as Arthur's Seat, Yokohama docks and the Ruhr valley. Ghost Peloton is a collaboration between NVA and Leeds based Phoenix Dance Theatre in association with Sustrans.]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[The Rutles]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA["Those songs are mine - I wrote them! Why can't we just go out and sing them?" complains Neil Innes, aka Ron Nasty of The Rutles. "Maybe we could call it "Rutalot", suggests John Halsey, aka Barry Wom, the "noisy one" of the so-called "Pre-Fab Four". BRAND ON THE RUN! It all began 35 years ago when Eric Idle of Monty Python persuaded Neil Innes, of the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band, to join him in a comedy series for BBC 2 called Rutland Weekend Television - all about a spoof TV station, the smallest in Britain, churning out really cheap programmes on a shoestring.

Low budget? More like No Budget!

Innes suggested to Idle that they could do a send-up of A Hard Day's Night, the Beatles first movie. "It's in Black and White, it's speeded up, and we could wear wigs and tight trousers and run around a field somewhere..." "Great!" Exclaimed Idle. "I've got a sketch about a man making a documentary who's so boring, the camera runs away from him..."

And so the name "Rutles" was born. But no one could have expected what happened next. A year later, such was the enormous pressure on the Beatles to get back together again, the one-off clip was shown in the USA - on NBC's flagship satire programme: "Saturday Night Live". It was a sensation. Thousands of people wrote in. Mailbags were bulging. So were the trousers! Everyone got the joke. Lorne Michaels, the producer, believed the whole Beatles story could now be told - as "The Rutles". NBC agreed and gave him the money. Eric Idle quickly came up with the title: "All You Need Is Cash - the story of the Pre-Fab Four". Bill Murray, John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd got involved - so did George Harrison, who brought in Mick Jagger and Paul Simon.

"Last time was just the last time. This time it really is the last time." Innes recalls: "I can clearly remember it all. I was sitting to one side, on a window sill in an executive office, high up in the Rockefeller Centre in New York, listening to all this when suddenly everyone started looking at me. Lorne asked if I could write 20 more Rutle songs by next Thursday lunchtime. I said I would try!" A second album, "Archaeology", with Mickey Simmonds (Keyboards) and "Rutle" Ricky Fataar (Stig O Hara) on drums, was released in 1996 - to even greater acclaim. Planned to coincide with the Beatles "Anthology" - by public demand - new songs like "Questionnaire" and "Don't Know Why" were more thoughtful and less of a parody - or as George Harrison sweetly put it - "all part of the soup". About 10 years ago, Neil, John and Mickey teamed up with Mark Griffiths on Bass and Ken Thornton on lead guitar, (Ken can almost replace the irreplaceable Ollie Halsall!) and played the Rutle songs live, on stage, in front of teabag throwing devotees, in village halls and at weddings, oh yes, and Glastonbury.

"It's not a career move," explains Innes, "but over the years we have become a "Brand" - and that makes some people very proprietorial."
"Pro what?" demands the man who was Barry Wom.
"Pro Prietor. You know - Legal Owner?" says Nasty the adjective.
"Oh. I'll keep quiet then."
"No, no - you can still hit the drums..."


"Making Rutle music is supposed to be fun, and it IS fun - but someone usually goes and spoils it all by saying something stupid like you can't do this or you can't say that and by laying down the law."
Innes continues with his beef, "with any luck by the time they get round to suing us we'll have disbanded again!"
"Why don't we just call it "Rutalot?" mutters the Noisy One...]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Stackridge formed in the early '70s, touring the UK, building a fanatical following and released 3 albums on MCA, "Stackridge", "Friendliness" and in 1974 "The Man in the Bowler Hat", which was produced by George Martin. This triumphant masterpiece, regarded by many to be George Martin's finest creation outside of his Beatles canon, the band recorded two more critically acclaimed albums, "Extravaganza" and "Mr. Mick" for Elton John's Rocket label.

Going their separate ways in 1976, they continued to make music. James Warren and Andy Davies gained notable success as electro-pop balladeers, The Korgis with two hit singles including the massive "Everybody's Got To Learn Sometime".

In 2006 the still devoted followers of the band were delighted when a reformed Stackridge started played a series of gigs, that included classic songs from the large back catalogue and a body of outstanding new material.

As ever, Stackridge has brought its' effervescent mix of melodic tunes, playful and poignant lyrics and instrumental exploration to their first album release on Helium Records. "A Victory For Common Sense", produced by Chris Hughes sees original members Andy Davis, "Mutter" Slater, "Crun" Walter and James Warren back together again and in truly fine form.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Part of the Alan Bennett Season.

Written and set in 1980s Leeds Alan Bennett's darkly comic play is an idiosyncratic examination of northern working-class life. The poetry of everyday life starkly contrasts the bitter reality of old age and the complexity of moving on.

"...groves deserted, drives emptied, terraces reaped of every house. Rubble... We're a relic. An ancient monument. We are living in the last back-to-backs inLeeds."

The Cravens, Mam, always singing and Dad repeatedly complaining are one of the few remaining occupants of the last back-to-backs inLeeds. As the bulldozers inch ever closer Dad looks forward to a new life in a maisonette with underfloor heating and the last word in waste disposal, whilst Mam is more reticent. The arrival of a series of eerily silent observers, noting the habits and customs of these relics of a bygone age add to the increasing air of menace.

Directed byJames Brining, this funny, twisted satire is Bennett at his absurd and form-busting best. ]]></description>

Dance Today

'Jaleo - sexy, sissling and Spanish.... passion and emotion consistently and movingly displayed.....Jaleo left behind wonderful warm memories of superb dancing and a big hot slice of southern Spain'

<description><![CDATA[The Tour de Cinema, working with National Trust, Cine Yorkshire and many other partners, will unveil thirty super-high-definition screens in unusual locations across Yorkshire for an unrivalled programme of fiction and non-fiction films about cycling.

The programme includes a brand new commission teaming up award-winning director Daisy Asquith with composer Bill Nelson and drawing on rare BFI film and music archives to chart the journey of the bicycle from new technology to familiar household transport.

It also highlights forgotten treasures like Alan Bennett's rarely seen BBC film from the 1970s - A Day Out, about a Halifax cycling club, and is a chance to see The Big Melt, paying homage to a century of steel-making with a blazing soundtrack compiled by Sheffield's Jarvis Cocker.

Alongside these gems, The Yorkshire Film Archive introduces a newly compiled film drawn from cine club and home movie collections to show cycling in all its forms, from childhood to adulthood.]]></description>

Mountains of papers and packaging fill his home from floor to ceiling and trap Richard in a world of his own, away from his community and any human connection.

<description><![CDATA[Jerry Sadowitz is best known as an offensive comedian but he is also one of the world's most skilled and creative card magicians. In this show you'll get to see some amazing sleight of hand and some original magic projected on a large screen which means you automatically get a front row seat without having to actually sit near him !!! Please note that this show is not suitable for anyone with less than &pound;22.50.

'Truly astonishing sleight of hand'
Guardian

'Genius ... astounds, amuses and appals in equal measure'
Times

 'Sadowitz delivers a non-stop scatological and politically incorrect banter while performing card, coin and other tricks that continually defeat the eye and challenge the mind. It is a brilliant and raucously funny performance from a unique comic talent.'
Colin Lewis

'Not for the easily offended but what a fantastic show of slick card tricks, slight of hand and hard hitting non-stop humour which comes at you like a runaway train !!. Very entertaining !!.'
Graham Todd

<event_title><![CDATA[Albert Hammond: Songbook 2014]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Albert Hammond has been writing hit songs for over forty years. There has not been a single decade in which Albert has not written multiple hits songs since he scored his first hit with Little Arrows at the age of 24. His songs have been responsible for the sale of over 360 million records worldwide including over 30 chart-topping hits. Many of his most beloved songs, like The Air That I Breathe and When I Need You, have become hits multiple times with various artists, decade after decade.

Albert's songs have repeatedly topped the international pop, R&B, country, adult contemporary and Latin charts, sometimes simultaneously. Included among these are the #1 hits When I Need You, Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now (nominated for an Oscar, Golden Globe and Grammy), One Moment in Time, and To All the Girls I've Loved Before.

Now after over 50 years of his successful career he recorded his first live album ever. Songbook 2013 was recorded in Wilhelmshaven, Germany during his recent SONGBOOK Tour, one very special night, a night that catches the hilarious moment between a stunning performer and his audience. Wilhelmshaven is a sleepy country town in Germany. Albert Hammond says "People who live on the country side really appreciate that IÂ´m coming into town to perform for them, you can feel it and that makes it very special for me."

The Live Double CD with over 30 classical songs of Albert Hammond is a testament of an outstanding singer and performer, it proves his fantastic skills as an entertainer who collaborates with his audience.

<description><![CDATA[Fans of beer and live music can swell the coffers of the Lord Mayors Appeal by attending the North Leeds Charity Beer Festival to be held on Friday 30th and Saturday 31st May 2014 at St Aidan's Community Hall on Roundhay Road. The Rotary Club of Roundhay will also be raising money for additional local, national and international charities.

This year the North Leeds Charity Beer Festival organised by The Rotary Club of Roundhay in association with The Lord Mayor of Leeds will have a Tour de France theme. Seventeen exclusive Le Tour de Yorkshire Grand Depart beers will be brewed especially for the 2014 festival. A further eleven beers brewed in Leeds will be served "in the wood". We will also have a selection of ciders and English Country Wines on offer.

CAMRA, The Campaign for Real Ale are offering their assistance and expert knowledge and their many volunteers will be making sure the beers are served correctly. A spokesman said, "If this is the first time anyone has visited a Beer Festival we want to ensure their experience is one they will enjoy and savour and will hook them to how beer should really taste

No event is complete without live music and there will be a number of bands performing throughout the North Leeds Charity Beer Festival. St Aidan's Community Hall is set over two floors so there will also be a quieter area where those who wish to can enjoy their beer in peace. Locally produced food will also be available and served at all times.

<description><![CDATA[The Rite of Spring/ Romeo and Juliet is a radical interpretation of Stravinsky's ballet and orchestral concert work in the theatrical setting of love and hatred between two Shakespeare's rivalling households, Capulet and Montague.

Conceived by Concert Theatre, the production uses commedia half masks and piano four-hands to create a music-centred physical theatre piece through the re-telling of Shakespeare's romantic tragedy.

<description><![CDATA[Jon Richardson is checking his tyre pressures, hoovering his floor mats and putting an emergency packed lunch in the boot of his car, ready to hit the road again with a brand new tour 'Nidiot'.  The perennial singleton and misanthrope is determined to become a more easygoing person for the sake of his friends and his future health.  Come and find out whether or not a leopard can change its spots, or if they are doomed to be angry forever not to have been given a more uniform and symmetrical fur pattern.

Away from his live stand up, British Comedy Award 2013 Nominee, Jon is best known as team captain on 8 Out Of 10 Cats. He is massively in demand for television and radio appearances. His recent TV credits include Have I Got News For You (BBC ONE), Live At The Apollo (BBC ONE), Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow (BBC ONE), Channel 4's Comedy Gala Live At The 02 and Never Mind The Buzzcocks (BBC TWO).

<event_title><![CDATA[FILMusic: Grouper And Paul Clipson]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[American Routes

HYPNOSIS DISPLAY

'The music of Grouper creates a feeling that can only be defined as awe, an uncanny mixture of wonder and dread that nobody does better' Pitchfork

A new FILMusic commission by Opera North, HYPNOSIS DISPLAY is a meditation on contemporary America in sound and image. Portland based musician Grouper (Liz Harris) juxtaposes layers of processed field recording, choral vocal harmony and keyboard in a resonant framework that moves behind and through Paul Clipson's 16mm film. Clipson's densely rhythmical images in turn traverse Grouper's musical language to create startling, revelatory, and critical associations.

Together they invite the audience to participate in a collective mind's-eye trip through landscapes of American myth making, including: the west coast, the worker, the city and the street.

<description><![CDATA[Claude Cahun (1894-1954) is best known for her riveting photographic self-portraits, that seem at least half a century ahead of their time where she acted out diverse identities both male and female in scenes that range from starkly minimal to the elaborately staged. She has inspired an almost cultish devotion among those who know her art. Cahun pioneered many of the concerns of contemporary artists like Cindy Sherman, who was born the year Cahun died. Cahun was born in France and was an avid participant in the cultural avant garde of Montparnasse in the 1920s and 30s mingling with many of the leading artists of her day, she eventually moved to Jersey, in the Channel Isles where she was imprisoned during the Nazi occupation.

<event_title><![CDATA[Create A Vision Board ]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[... for the next chapter of your life.

Before you set out on a journey it helps to know where you're going. If not, you're going to end up SOMEWHERE . . . just not where you want to be.

What if your elusive dreams took shape before your eyes? What would you discover? What could you then bring into your life for real?

Vision boards are a fabulous technique for focussing our energy and commitment on what's important. Then we get to have more of it in our lives. Pictures, words, photos, lines from poems, colour - they all help to create a powerful reminder of what you want in your future.

Making them in a workshop is fun, playful, stress free and collaborative. You get to share ideas and tell other people about yours. That's the added extra of doing this with others - you get to say it out loud as well.

"I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I lived just the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well." Diane Ackerman

This workshop will suit anyone who is
- Seeking a different way to approach the new year.
- Wanting to look at your life as a whole and create greater fulfilment and richness in it.
- Has an idea for a specific project you want to create (and maybe you keep putting it on the back burner).
- Planning something big like a wedding, new business idea or retirement.

This special workshop retreat is for a maximum of 6 people, book early to be sure you're one of them. How about booking a place with your partner and creating a shared vision for your future.

During the workshop you'll
- Plug into the power of your dreams.
- Get in contact with your wisest inner self and use that inner knowing to create your vision from.
- Be coached to explore that vision so it becomes richer and more vibrant.
- Create your own vision board using a collage of images, words and colour.
- Talk about the significance of the elements of your vision so you get to hear yourself claim it out loud.
- Plan how you're going to use your board to keep focussed on what's important to you.
- Spend a day in a warm, cosy home, eat well, share laughter and have some playful fun cutting out!

" My partner and I did this course with Tilla - this weekend we have a romantic retreat by the sea to complete our shared vision board!"   Helen Collier, Money Coach HarmoneyLife

All you need is comfy clothes, a desire to create your own life and an open mind. The desire to have that fun will also come in useful! This is Blue Peter for adults!

I'll provide all the materials, and if you want to bring along old magazines to share around that'll be great.

Following an encounter with The Wizard, their friendship reaches a crossroads and their lives take very different paths. Glinda's unflinching desire for popularity sees her seduced by power while Elphaba's determination to remain true to herself, and to those around her, will have unexpected and shocking consequences for her future. Their extraordinary adventures in Oz will ultimately see them fulfil their destinies as Glinda The Good and the Wicked Witch of the West.

<event_title><![CDATA[Gotterdammerung]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Twilight of the Gods

Opera North's four-year traversal of Der Ring des Nibelungen reaches the cycle's overwhelming conclusion. The all-consuming love of Siegfried and Bruunhilde is broken in bitter betrayal; the machinations of Hagen, son of Alberich, seal Siegfried's doom; and Bruunhilde's self-immolation precipitates the end of the old world order and the beginning of a new era.

The musical and dramatic power of Gotterdammerung is awe-inspiring - from Siegfried's Rhine Journey, to the mighty chorus of the Gibichung vassals, in which the Chorus of Opera North is joined by the internationally renowned Huddersfield Choral Society, to Siegfried's Funeral March, and - above all - to Brunnhilde's immolation and the work's titanic orchestral climax.

Alwyn Mellor, widely praised for her radiant portrayal of Sieglinde in Opera North's Die Walkre in 2012, sings the role of Brunnhilde in these performances. She is joined by a cast that also includes the American tenor Daniel Brenna as Siegfried and Susan Bickley as Waltraute. All are under the guidance of Opera North's Music Director Richard Farnes, whose conducting of the previous instalments of this cycle has been universally acclaimed.

Lasts approximately 6 hours 15 mins.

Please note: performance time includes two intervals, one of 30 mins, and one of 1 hour 15 mins.

Sung in German with English titles

A collaboration with The Sage Gateshead and Symphony Hall, Birmingham.

Financially supported by the Opera North Future Fund and The Ring Fellowship.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The Tour de Cinema, working with National Trust, Cine Yorkshire and many other partners, will unveil thirty super-high-definition screens in unusual locations across Yorkshire for an unrivalled programme of fiction and non-fiction films about cycling.

The programme includes a brand new commission teaming up award-winning director Daisy Asquith with composer Bill Nelson and drawing on rare BFI film and music archives to chart the journey of the bicycle from new technology to familiar household transport.

It also highlights forgotten treasures like Alan Bennett's rarely seen BBC film from the 1970s - A Day Out, about a Halifax cycling club, and is a chance to see The Big Melt, paying homage to a century of steel-making with a blazing soundtrack compiled by Sheffield's Jarvis Cocker.

Alongside these gems, The Yorkshire Film Archive introduces a newly compiled film drawn from cine club and home movie collections to show cycling in all its forms, from childhood to adulthood.]]></description>

Musical Arc, a charity for disabled musicians, has commissioned shadow theatre artist Rebekah Caputo to devise a shadow show of a traditional indian folk story; The Mango Tree. Rebekah is also working with Indian Kathak dancer Jyoti Manral and contemporary dancer Amy Manancourt to bring to life this magical tale of princesses, demons, lotis flowers and managos! An original soundtrack devised and played by Musical Arc will accompany the performance led by Lorraine Cowburn as artistic director. Using ground breaking techniques and a multiscreen set, the production will merge shadow and dance; dancers will become shadow puppets, puppets will become dancers in a seamless fusion between what is in front, and, behind the screens.

<event_title><![CDATA[Angelic Upstarts]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Formed on a South Shields council estate in 1977, the Upstarts soon attracted notoriety due to their aggressive music and uncompromising attitude. Their debut single "The Murder Of Liddle Towers" was self-released in 1978 and then picked up by Rough Trade and went on to sell many thousands of copies. It told the story of a boxing coach who was killed while in police custody and is one of the most incendiary punk 45s ever released. Even today it sounds incredible, dripping with anger, and its less than polished production being perfect. The B-side "Police Oppression" was also a brilliant track and singer Thomas "Mensi" Mensforth still gets harrassed from the police who have never forgiven him for these tunes.

Critical acclaim led the band to sign a major label deal and the release of their second single "I'm An Upstart". Once again this was a blistering piece of UK punk that hasn't lost its intensity over thirty years later. The band eventually received mainstream success with their third effort "Teenage Warning", which got them on Top Of The Pops and was to be their biggest hit. Over thirty years after their greatest anthems were released, the songs of the Angelic Upstarts take on a new resonance in these times of global recession and rising unemployment, not to mention the UK continuing to be involved in imperial adventures overseas. These tunes are arguably far more relevant than anything The Clash or The Sex Pistols ever put out. The Upstarts might have lacked a certain level of finesse but their integrity was never in doubt.]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Joe Longthorne]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[This talented artist began his career over three decades ago with appearances on Junior Showtime, followed by a grounding on the tough Northern club circuit.

His big break came in 1981 when he was a finalist on London Weekend Television's Search for a Star - this lead to appearances at the London Palladium with Bob Hope and The Talk of the Town. A short time later, Joe received the Variety Club of Britain award as Most Promising Artiste of the Year. Television specials in the UK and USA followed.

Joe's repertoire of voices is endless and includes hundreds of the world's top singers, however, he is perhaps best known for his impersonation of Shirley Bassey who has commented, "Joe can do me better than I can do myself".

During his career, Joe has received gold and platinum discs for his albums, enjoyed sell-out concerts at the Royal Albert Hall, as well as touring Australia several times.

Now, Joe is looking forward to new challenges, new songs to sing and new audiences to thrill.]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Dolly Parton]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Iconic singer, songwriter, musician, actress and philanthropist Dolly Parton will be coming to the first direct arena next June as part of her Blue Smoke World Tour.


Dolly's latest studio album of all new material "Blue Smoke" will be available worldwide on Dolly Records with a release date to be announced soon.

Speaking ahead of her first direct arena show, Dolly said "Every time I come to Europe I'm just as excited as I was my very first time, which was many, many years ago.  I love that part of the world and I especially love the fans," adds Parton.  "We always have such a good time and I've put together a lot of things for this show that I think the fans will love.  We had not planned to come back so soon, but we got so much fan mail and such a great reaction that I thought 'Well, why not.  If they're having a good time and we always do, let's just do it'."

In 2011, Dolly continued to receive accolades for what was her most successful European and Australian tour of her 45-plus year career-The Better Day World Tour! During the 2011 tour, Dolly performed for record-breaking attendances in both Europe and Australia, surpassing her previous attendance records. In 2008, Dolly performed 17 European shows to over 170,000 fans, surpassing her then-best 2007 European tour, where she played 21 shows for over 140,000 people.  Each of these treks grossed in the tens of millions of dollars and established Dolly as Europe's favorite and most successful country artist. ]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Once In A Lifetime - The Final Tour]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[The Osmonds, Showaddywaddy, David Essex and Les Mckeown's Legendary Bay City Rollers.

Once In A Lifetime - The Final Tour is the very last chance to see your favourite acts together all on one stage.

For over five decades The Osmond Brothers have been entertaining sold out crowds throughout the world. This tour will see them perform many of their unforgettable hits - from classics such as One Bad Apple, Down By The Lazy River, Let Me In, The Proud One, Goin Home and Love Me For A Reason to Crazy Horses and Long Haired Lover From Liverpool - the 1972 number one hit from Jimmy.

From hit records to hit musicals David Essex OBE has had one of the most enduring careers in music - lasting over 40 years to date. His breadth of hits include two number one's - Gonna Make U A Star and Hold Me Close - and other top ten hits include Rock On, Lamplight, Stardust, Oh What A Circus, Brave New World, Silver Dream Machine and A Winter's Tale.

Showaddywaddy have long been established as Europe's most successful ever exponents of retro-inspired rock & roll. They have had 23 Top 40 hit singles including the 10 Top five hits Under The Moon of Love, When, You Got What It Takes, 3 Steps To Heaven, and Hey Rock & Roll.

Les McKeowen's Legendary Bay City Rollers' music became the soundtrack for a generation of teenagers growing up in the mid 70's. The face and voice of that soundtrack belonged to Les McKeown. The band's singles and albums shot to the number spot all over the globe. Massive hits such as Bye Bye Baby, Shang A Lang, Summer Love Sensation, I Only Want To Be With You, All Of Me Loves All Of You and Give A Little Love (to name just a few) propelled the band to world-wide superstardom and their trademark Scottish tartan was to be seen everywhere across the planet.

<description><![CDATA[Bicyclism is a new exhibition about people in and around Leeds who inhabit cycling, its history and popular culture. A collaboration between photographer Casey Orr, writer/musician Boff Whalley and curator Jenny Harris, Bicyclism includes a series of new portraits of (extra) ordinary Leeds cyclists, from stunt bikers in skate parks to local men and women who pedal daily well into old age, alongside crowd-sourced and archive images of Leeds people on their bikes.

The exhibition will unearth stories and histories of the area's cycling past, from the socialist Clarion Clubs to the role played by bicycles in the suffrage movement, from cycling cafe culture to the role of the many cycling clubs (and the cyclists) in Leeds' social history, geography and landscape.

A new soundtrack composed using bicycles will accompany the exhibition. Watch the live at the Museum on Thursday 26th June.

Be Part Of It: If you have a photo in your album of you or a family member on their bike that you would like to submit for inclusion in the exhibition visit www.bicyclism.co.uk for more information.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Berlyn Trilogy, Black Planet, Palmeres

Yorkshire has a long established history of electronic music spanning back to the late 70's. Acts like Human League, Cabaret Voltaire and Heaven 17 paved the way. Sheffield being the central hub during the early years but Leeds also gave birth to Soft Cell and the Sisters of Mercy.

The Dance music scene of the late 80's and 90's carried on this tradition with clubs The Orbit and Back to basics bring through a new breed of producer/artist. LFO and The Utah Saints hit the big time along side Sheffield's seminal label Warp.

To this day the region has been a hot bed for all things electronic. Electronic Gears aim in one night to show the rich pioneering musical heritage that Yorkshire has to offer.

A line up of Live bands, Producers and DJs will perform and show why Yorkshire is still at the cutting edge of the electronic music scene.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Written by Maxine Peake Beryl celebrates the extraordinary sporting achievements of Morley cyclist Beryl Burton.

It was 1954 when Beryl Charnock met keen cyclist Charlie Burton.  In those days they cycled in clubs and once Beryl started she was smitten, not only with Charlie but by the thrill and freedom found on two wheels. Beryl was better than good, she was the best and she was determined to stay that way.

Five times world champion, thirteen times national champion, twice road-racing world champion and twelve times national champion. Her accolades include time trials, former world record holder, former British record holder, numerous sports awards an MBE and an OBE. BerylBurtonwas one of the most astonishing sports people ever to have lived - but with her down to earth, no-nonsense approach to life and to success, she remains a mystery.

To celebrate Yorkshire's role in this year's Tour de France, this is a specially commissioned adaptation from Maxine Peake's acclaimed 2012 Radio 4 play and marks her stage writing debut. ]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[It is official: The world's greatest cycle race - the Tour de France - will start in the world's greatest county on 5th & 6th July 2014 bringing millions of fans to the Yorkshire roadside to cheer on the champions of the sport.

It will be the first time Le Tour has visited the north of England having previously only made visits to the south coast and the capital. We guarantee it will be a festival and a spectacle for fans and first timers alike and are sure Yorkshire will rise to occasion and give the riders, the teams and the race organisers a Grand Depart to remember. Yorkshire is a world class county and it will deliver a world class event.

The official route of the 2014 race including road-by-road details of the route the legendary cycle race will take through Leeds when the Grand Depart begins in the city on the morning of Saturday 5 July can be seen at the website - www.letouryorkshire.com.

After completing the official signing-in ceremony in front of Leeds Town Hall, the world's leading riders will then line up on The Headrow for the ceremonial start of the Tour de France. The initial non-racing rollout will see the peloton ride along The Headrow to Eastgate before turning left onto Regent Street and following the A61 out of town towards Harewood.

For those keen to view the race as it journeys through Leeds, there will be spectator 'hubs' including family-focused activities at Scott Hall playing fields and Harewood House with other locations also being discussed.

The route of stage one is to start to be permanently waymarked so cyclists and motorists can follow the stage themselves in the build-up and following the Grand Depart.

Routes of the Grand Depart including interactive maps are available on www.letouryorkshire.com]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Rhys Darby: Mr Adventure]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[From the misty mountains of Rwanda to the eerie shores of Loch Ness, Rhys has attempted to see it all...  Now he's back to tell you the stories.

Expect tales of awe from the summit of Mt Kilimanjaro, wild wonderment as he visits some of the biggest malls in the world and hilarious live reenactments of his cryptic discoveries in gun-toting Texas!

In 2012 Darby bought us the fantastical tale of what he thought would happen when the Mayan calendar runs out.  Clearly the world did not end, so Rhys traverses mountains and explores the earth in an effort to show that life can still be a massive adventure bordering on the unbelievable.  Often with the family in tow, he shows you don't need to be in the jungle or climbing mountains to find adventures in everyday life.

No one brings a yarn to life better than Darby with his classic onstage physicality.  Pack your girdle, you're likely to lose your insides laughing!  Join him as he regales you with tales so thrilling you'd swear he was making them up.

In between his huge adventures Darby is based in Los Angeles with his family where they like to hike and eat tacos and he appears regularly on US TV in shows like How I met your Mother and The Late Show with David Letterman  and as Percy the Penguin in Disney Jr's Jake and the Neverland Pirates.

Winner: Best NZ Comedy (The Fred) 2012, NZ International Comedy Festival

Climbed Mt Kilimanjaro (5,895 m) 2013

<description><![CDATA[Five day Skinner Releasing Technique and Movement workshop.

This course will take advantage of our location, integrating the beautiful surrounding countryside of Yorkshire with the imagery used in SRT and using this as a spring board for creative work. The course will include two trips out into Yorkshire's breath-taking countryside to visit Brimham Rocks and Timble which will feed into our creative explorations in the studio.

Skinner Releasing Technique (SRT) is a pioneering approach to dance, movement and creative process that has evolved from the simple principle that when we are releasing physical tension, we can move with greater freedom, power and articulation. Artists, actors, dancers, musicians, poets and curious explorers of all kinds welcome! All levels of experience welcome.

"A fantastic experience. Excellent teachers... very accessible, inspiring introduction to the technique. The best course I have ever experienced by far!!! I will take all I have learnt back into my practice and continue experiencing the work." Participant Feedback - Moving Landscapes'13

"Love the invitation for non-dancers - I never felt intimidated or out danced. Have seen a definite change in my body and felt so much more." Participant Feedback - Moving Landscapes '13.

<event_title><![CDATA[Leeds Ska And Mod Festival]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Leeds Ska and Mod Festival The Music that changed everything!

Playing for the first time together, Red Eagle Events brings you four of the biggest Mod and Ska Bands in the UK.

Featured bands

From the Jam, fronted by one of the original Modfathers Bruce Foxton, hits include: A Town Called Malice

The Beat fronted by Ranking Roger and Ranking Jr, hits include: Tears of a Clown

Bad Manners fronted by Buster bloodvessel, hits include: Special Brew

The Selecter fronted by Gaps Hendrickson and the one and only Pauline Black, hits include "On My Radio".

Ska is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s, and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and Calypso with American Jazz and Rhythm and Blues. It is characterised by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the upbeat. In the early 1960s, Ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British Mods.

Music historians typically divide the history of Ska into three periods: the original Jamaican scene of the 1960s (First Wave); the English 2 Tone Ska revival of the late 1970s (Second Wave); and the third wave of the Ska movement which started in the 1980s (Third Wave) and rose to popularity in the US in the 1990s.

Mods, initially a small group of clothes-focused 1950s working class young men insisted on clothes and shoes tailored to their style, which emerged during the Jazz boom. Early mods watched French and Italian art films and read Italian magazines to look for style ideas. By the summer of 1966, the mod scene was in sharp decline but a Mod revival started in the late 1970s in the United Kingdom. Thousands of Mod revivalists attended scooter rallies in locations such as Scarborough and the Isle of Wight. This revival was partly inspired by the 1979 film Quadrophenia and by Mod-influenced bands such as The Jam, who drew on the energy of New Wave music.

The British Mod revival was followed by a revival in North America in the early 1980s, particularly in Southern California, led by bands such as The Untouchables. The mod scene in Los Angeles and Orange County was partly influenced by the 2 Tone Ska revival in England, and was unique in its racial diversity, with black, white, Hispanic and Asian participants. The 1990s Britpop scene featured noticeable Mod influences on bands such as Oasis, Blur, Ocean Colour Scene and The Verve.

From the Jam, The Beat, The Selecter & Bad Manners are all UK Ska & Mod bands who have seen decades in the music industry racking up many top 10 hits!

So join us and let's make history!]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The 9th annual Leeds Gay Pride event in the city.

The Committee have chosen this years theme to reflect the ongoing push for change and equality and recognise the legalisation to allow same sex marriage in the United Kingdom. Love&Marriage will feature strongly in our campaign and shows as we celebrate this important milestone in LGB&T rights.

Its time to buy a hat!

This year, we are pleased to introduce Gay Leeds Legends Kira & Degsie as your Parade Stage hosts as well as inviting back the one and only Miss Orry on Main Stage - flying back from Gran Canaria to join her is Chelsea from Ricky's Cabaret Bar.

Starting in Millennium Square at midday, the parade stage officially kicks off Leeds Pride with speakers and a selection of performances. Then join the parade through Leeds as it winds its way down to Briggate or "Gay Leeds" where the party continues.

The main stage in the heart of the LGBT community will showcase even more local stars as well as popular LGBT scene performers, camp cabaret, a headliner and our ever popular dance session.

We are the UK's fastest growing LGB&T pride and the biggest
annual street event in the City of Leeds. With your support we hope to continue delivering a top class pride for Leeds. Here is just a taster of what's to come...

Stooshe
Your headline act for Main Stage at this years
LeedsPride. Since 2010, this UK trio have belted out top 20 hit after hit with single - "Slip" holding steady as a Summer 2013 anthem. MOBO & Brit Award nominated, get set for our BIGGEST headline act to date.

Lonnie Gordon
3 UK top 40 hits // 3 US Number 1's. Philliadelphia (USA) born Lonnie Gordon is a 90's Dance legend working with names such as BlackBox. Her most memorable hits include "Gonna Catch you" & "Happenin all over again". Lonnie is about to release her new single "Horny". She will be joining the Main Stage line up at Leeds Pride 2014.

Katrina
(Katrina & the Waves) Katrina is an American musician, author and former lead singer of English pop rock band Katrina and The Waves. The hit song "Walking on Sunshine", billed in the top 10 of charts across the globe and is still the most played summer track on radio in the US, 28 years after its release. In 1997, Katrina restored British faith in the  Eurovision Song Contest- breaking through political & block voting with the anthem "Love Shine a Light", giving the United Kingdom its first win in Decades. Katrina will headline the Parade Stage at Millennium Square before this years big parade sets off!

More acts will be confirmed in the run up to the event.

There's much more info on the website and facebook page which is constantly updated in the run up to Leeds Pride.

<description><![CDATA[Directed by Sara Kestelman
Book, Music and Lyrics by Benjamin Till
To commemorate the centenary of the outbreak of the Great War NYMT has commissioned a new work from Benjamin Till. The story follows a group of Leeds residents from the start of the war until the battle of the Somme in 1916. The men, members of an amateur brass band, join up to the Leeds Pals regiment and their womenfolk decide to learn the instruments that the men have left behind to keep the spirit of the brass band alive and to play for them when they triumphantly return to the city after the war. We watch the women trying to learn the brass instruments whilst the men simply try to stay alive. It is an epic musical about love and survival.

<event_title><![CDATA[The Mousetrap]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[The Mousetrap is celebrating the 62nd year of a record breaking run during which over 25,000 performances have been given, including a sell-out run at Leeds Grand Theatre last year. An iconic piece of theatrical history, this is a classic whodunit written by the greatest crime writer of all time.

The scene is set when a group of people gathered in a country house cut off by the snow discover, to their horror, that there is a murderer in their midst. Who can it be? One by one the suspicious characters reveal their sordid pasts until at the last, nerve-shredding moment the identity and the motive are finally revealed.

In her own inimitable style, Dame Agatha Christie has created an atmosphere of shuddering suspense and a brilliantly intricate plot where murder lurks around every corner.

'the cleverest murder mystery of British Theatre'
THE TELEGRAPH

'deservedly a classic among murder thrillers'
THE OBSERVER

Feedback from a previous participant "A wonderfully creative and relaxing day in great company in a beautiful eco centre and natural environment. My willow hare now stands proudly in my garden - making me smile every morning when I look out! Thank you so much Phil and the welcoming team at Skelton Grange - when is the next course??!!"

<event_title><![CDATA[Sam Sweeney's Fiddle: Made In The Great War]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[A multi-media performance telling the incredible story of a Leeds fiddle which took nearly a century to complete, to mark the 100th anniversary of the start of World War I.

In 2009 Sam Sweeney, fiddle player with Bellowhead, bought a violin in Oxford.  It had all the appearance of a new instrument but the label inside gave the date 1915 and the name Richard S Howard. Research revealed that the violin had been made - but never finished - by a luthier and some-time music hall performer from Leeds called Richard Spencer Howard.  He had been conscripted in 1915 at the age of 35 and two years later was killed during the battle of Messines Ridge.  The unfinished violin was given to his daughter Rose as a memory of her father.  On her death the parts were bought at auction and the violin was finally finished by luthier Roger Claridge in 2007.  The fiddle was then placed in the window of an Oxford music shop where it was spotted by Sam.

This multi-media performance, telling the incredible story of the fiddle, marks the 100th anniversary of the start of World War I.  Collaborating with award-winning story-teller Hugh Lupton, fellow Bellowhead band mate Paul Sartin and acclaimed concertina player Rob Harbron, as well as Bellowhead lighting designer Emma Thompson who has developed set, projections and lighting for the show, Made in the Great War will bring the reality of World War I into 2014, as Sam performs the show with the actual fiddle made by non-returning World War I soldier Richard Howard.

Sam Sweeney's Fiddle: Made in the Great War is supported by funding from Arts Council England and the English Folk Dance & Song Society.]]></description>

Over the course of his career, Taylor has earned 40 gold, platinum and multi-platinum awards and five Grammy Awards for a catalogue running from 1970's Sweet Baby James to 2008's Covers.

The soundtrack is played live on stage by the extraordinarily talented cast - you won't see anything like this anywhere in Yorkshire. It's a real treat.

The production will be the sixth UK tour in eight years.  Jeff Wayne said: "Bringing The War of The Worlds to life in many of the world's finest arenas has been the most amazing experience for me over the last seven years. We've achieved more than we ever thought was possible both musically and technologically.

However, the time is right to take The War of The Worlds in new directions after the 2014 tour. I am so very appreciative of the fantastic support over the years from so many established fans as well as numerous new ones we've attracted. Thank you all sincerely.

All I can say for the future of TWOTW is - Watch this space!"]]></description>

<event_title><![CDATA[Andre Rieu]]></event_title>
<description><![CDATA[Famous for conducting his Johann Strauss Orchestra, choir and soloists with his violin bow, Andre Rieu always brings a sense of extravagance to his live performances.

From famous Viennese operettas to film scores, spirituals to musicals, and from folk songs to marches; Rieu's concerts are a perfect mix of thrilling, romantic, festive and emotional melodies combined with surprises, balloons, beautiful soloists and of course Rieu's great sense of humor.

Speaking ahead of his first direct arena show, Andre said "The British and Irish are really a fantastic audience. Their sense of humour and enthusiasm are unmatched. For my orchestra and me it's like being amongst friends. Every year we welcome more and more British at our home concert in Maastricht. And even there they create this unforgettable atmosphere. So we are looking forward to coming back"
